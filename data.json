She also launched CDs and educational kits to make people aware about the disease. Walia said HIV/AIDS patients and their attendants will be allowed to travel free on DTC buses to Anti Retroviral Therapy centres as well as to go to the hospital for checkup and treatment. Government was also considering providing BPL cards to HIV/AIDS affected persons so that they get food items at subsidised price, she said, adding her department will also take care passing of nutritional requirement of the affected persons. The Minister said requests have also been received to allow the patients free ride on Metro rail. For this government will take up the matter with DMRC. Walia said Government will also make available CT scan, MRI, Ultrasound and other special tests at government hospitals free of cost for such patients."}

Guwahati's 35-year-old Junali (name changed on request), who lost her husband three years ago to HIV/AIDS, is among thousands of HIV-positive people in northeast India and elsewhere excited by the prospects of finding a good match through the website. \"I am pinning all my hopes to find a genuine match on the proposed website. I want to live a life with dignity and want someone who is intelligent, sober, and caring,\" Junali told IANS. The website (www.hitchiv.com) to be launched later this month at the behest of the Indian Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS (INP+) has already generated a lot of interest among HIV- positive people. \"We have already got about 150 to 200 requests for membership despite the fact that the website is yet to be launched,\" Jahnabi Goswami, president of INP+, said. Goswami, 32, is one of the few women in India fighting to raise awareness about the disease. She belongs to an even smaller group of people who have publicly declared that they are HIV- positive. Membership to the website would be open only to people living with HIV/AIDS. \"Strict privacy would be maintained and only registered members will be able to log in and scan profiles of prospective partners,\" Goswami said. There are thousands of people living with HIV/AIDS interested in marriage and leading a normal life with dignity, but since they cannot get in touch with like-minded people, their dreams remained unfulfilled. \"It is an excellent idea to have this website as marriages between an HIV- positive couple would enable them not only to lead a happy life but also to take care of and support each other, which is very important,\" S.I. Ahmed, head of the AIDS Prevention Society, a community healthcare group in Assam, said. INP+ would arrange pre-marital counselling to prospective couples interested in having children post-marriage. \"When it comes to marriage the couple would surely be told about the pros and cons,\" Ahmed added."}

With his previous experience as chair of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, reputedly among the most productive multinational research organizations working on HIV pathogenesis and therapy, Schooley was an important contributor to the two-day ART Symposium in the city organized by YRG Care over the weekend to discuss cutting-edge technology in the field. Speaking to TOI on Sunday about new scientific advances in the field, Schooley said, \"There are a host of approaches being adopted by researchers worldwide to try and eradicate HIV however the approaches using either enzymes or RNA to remove infected cells are ultimately the most hopeful and will be the least disruptive for the patient. Paula Cannon, a researcher from California, for instance, has been working on ways to identify HIV-infected cells called CD4 cells (so called because they have a molecule on the surface called CD4) which is a gateway for the virus. These cells have a second molecule called CCR5 which is a second door that the virus has to pass through. Now, she has created a way for the second molecule to be changed so that they virus cannot recognize it. In this approach, the virus stays outside the cell.\" Elaborating on Cannon's research, he said she had been able to demonstrate it successfully in mice. \"The next step will be to take people with HIV infection who have lymphoma and so, would need a bone marrow transplant for their tumours. She would treat the stem cells and hopefully the bone marrow so grafted would afford the patients' cells protection from HIV,\" Schooley said. Pointing out that this was an experiment that had to be done, he cited the example of a similar case but with a natural modification of the CCR5 molecule being reported in the New York Journal of Medicine about 18 months ago. \"After the HIV-infected individual underwent a bone marrow transplant from such a donor, no one could demonstrate the presence of HIV in the patient. So, there is certainly some preliminary support for her research,\" he said. Commenting on India's research potential, Schooley said that biotechnology was growing at an excellent pace in the country. \"There is some state of the art research work being carried out by YRG Care and some fantastically sophisticated research at National Aids Research Institute, Pune. In fact, the component sites that we have in Chennai and Pune are among the most productive. We are carrying out trials on the best drugs to use for HIV infections, treating people with drug failure and drug resistance and treating people suffering from HIV and Tuberculosis at the same time. There is a lot of important work being carried out over here. India is one of the best places for research activity worldwide,\" he added."}

The hapless woman was thrown out by her husband after she had tested HIV+ during delivery of her baby last year. Although she got the infection from her husband but the latter refuses to keep her saying that he has no money to bear the cost of treatment. He has also kept the baby with him. \u201cI knocked at every door possible, be it NGOs or government organisations but only got sympathies,\u201d said Poonam while narrating how her husband snatched her four-month-old daughter from her and threw her out of the house. \u201cWith no money and means of livelihood, I first went to my parents but my father was also not ready to accept me. My mother, however, intervened and helped me in approaching various government agencies and NGOs for help. However, at all the places people only made promises but none helped,\u201d she rued. Poonam only want a job so that she can be financially independent and can claim custody of her daughter. In her letter, Poonam has described how hundreds of HIV+ women like her who want to stand on their feet and fight stigma but are being pushed back by government agencies and NGOs who thrive on grants procured in the name of HIV/AIDS awareness and welfare. \u201cI hope being a women chief minister will help me out,\u201d said Poonam who signed the letter \u201cone of your daughter\u201d. A dejected Poonam has also said that she would be forced to commit suicide, if no help came from the chief minister. \u201c What option do I have...should I take to prostitution and infect others...or beg on streets... better to end life,\u201d she said. Poonam was just 16 when she was married to one Rajesh, who works as salesman in a small firm. The marriage does not have a legal sanctity because she was minor at that time. She has studied till class XI, which is also not enough to get a job. \u201c I understand the limitations but I am only asking for a job, may be a peon or a counsellor at any AIDS awareness centre or any task which may earn enough to take care of myself,\u201d she said. At present, she survives on little money her mother sends every month. During the day, she wanders on the streets looking for work and in the night finds shelter in railways and bus stations. The woman also knocked the door of the State Women Commission and State Aids Control Society as well as other NGOs working for HIV positive people but got only assurances. The episode has also exposed the poor state of affairs in government set up for providing relief and rehabilitation to abandoned HIV+ women and children. There are over 1000 NGOs, funded by the government and other national international organisations, working in the field of HIV/AIDS in UP but none have any shelter home, barring \u2018Shanti Niketan\u2019 run by the \u2018Sisters of Saint Joseph\u2019, a Christian missionary organisation, but it has limited capacity. The state has over 1.4 lakh HIV+ people, of which nearly 30% are widows who acquired infection from their husbands but after their death were disowned by in-laws. Many like Poonam are denied shelter by their parents as well. Some also have children. The only option for them is to lead a traumatised life and die in oblivion. Officers claim that government gives enough funds to the NGOs for the job. The Lucknow Network for People living with HIV and AIDS has been helping such widows but resources are limited. Members complain that NGOs take grants in the name of HIV/AIDS but have done more harm to victims than infection."}

After a public hearing on `Child rights -- issues and entitlements of the orphan and vulnerable children affected/infected by HIV/ AIDS', Shantha Sinha, chairperson, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), said four things topped their list of demands. \"A comprehensive nutrition programme is needed. Continuation of education is a problem for most because of social stigma,\" she said. The question of property rights is another bane for these children because many are thrown out of their homes with even siblings distancing themselves. \"This is fracturing families. Also, in several cases, there are no parents and children have to take care of the family. There are no rules on these cases ought to be handled,\" she added. The national commission is also mulling over a comprehensive child health policy and on conducting such public hearing at the district level. These have been held in Andhra Pradesh, Manipur and Tamil Nadu. A pilot hearing in Udupi, where the incidence of HIV/AIDS affected children is very high, is being considered. Both the national and state commissions were unanimous in saying the biggest problem was that there was no data on children affected by HIV/AIDS. However, it's estimated there are about 55,000 children orphaned due to AIDS or other reasons in just three districts of Belgaum, Bagalkot and Bellary. Guidelines not operational Though there are guidelines for children with HIV/AIDS, which have details on how to handle such cases, social workers say these are not yet operational on ground. Neither has the HIV Bill been passed. Nina P Naik, chairperson, Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said there was no plan in the state for children affected with HIV/AIDS. If parents die, the ration card for the family is cancelled and they are not considered to be below the poverty line. \"HIV positive women with a son over 18 years no longer gets a widow pension. There is also a movement nationwide to include HIV positive people under the disability pension scheme,\" she added. It's been estimated that every 15 seconds a child loses a parent to AIDS and there are about 2 million children under 15 years who are living with HIV. According to a UNAIDS 2008 report, about 15 million orphans are AIDS orphans. toiblr.reporter@timesgroup.com"}

The state already has four ART centres at Patna Medical College and Hospital, Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital-Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital-Laheriasarai and Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital-Bhagalpur. ART centres provide facilities like counselling, pathological tests for assessing the CD4 count and free medicines, if required. Bihar has at present 13,539 HIV+ persons registered with the existing ART centres. Of them, 6,478 have been put on ART therapy.

He said some of the patients registered with the existing ART centres would be shifted to the new ones. This would not only rationalise the distribution of workload to the ART centres but also reduce the distance the HIV+ patients have to cover to reach these centres. Plans are also afoot to start 19 link ART centres in addition to the existing five. \"This would further make things easier for the HIV+ cases,\" Alex said. The link ART centres free the HIV+ patients of the vicinity from the monthly chore of coming to the ART centres as they get counselling and medicines at the link ART centres. They, however, have to come to the ART centres for the CD count test every six months. The five link ART centres which have recently been made functional are at Nawada, Begusarai, Saran, Hajipur and Mokama. The process of linking HIV+ cases of these areas with the link centres is on. The new link ART centres are likely to become functional within the next three months in Bhojpur, Gopalganj, Arwal, Lakhisarai, Samastipur, East Champaran, West Champaran, Sitamarhi, Madhubani, Munger, Kishanganj, Katihar, Purnia, Araria, Khagaria, Nalanda, Siwan, Jehanabad and Aurangabad districts."}

But, Dr Williams said, the universal therapy with anti-retroviral drugs could prove to be the most promising way of controlling a disease. It also has the potential to halve tuberculosis infections associated with HIV and AIDS. \"It would be enough to stop transmission and make most people effectively not infectious to others,\" Dr Williams, a former WHO epidemiologist who still advises the United Nations body, was quoted as saying by the Sunday Times. \"The question is can we use anti-retroviral drugs not only to keep people alive but also to stop transmission? I believe that we can,\" Dr Williams said. \"I believe that if we use them effectively we could stop transmission within five years.\u201d \"Treating people with ART within one year of becoming infected would reduce transmission by about ten times, each person with HIV would infect, on average, less than one other person, and the epidemic would die out.\""}

However, Mumbai's dream to be counted as one of the cities with lesser prevalence of HIV still remains a distant one. The city's AIDS control body, Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), has collated figures for the last four years and concluded that the prevalence of the virus has come down from 10.65% in 2007 to 7.69% in 2010 (till May) among the general population. For pregnant women too, the decline has been from 0.91% to 0.58% during the same period. Authorities attribute the decline to increased awareness among youth. \"It is the combined effect of awareness and our targeted interventions. Our biggest victory has been to prevent new infections,'' said project director of MDACS, Dr S S Kudalkar. The MDACS studied the data from 74 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres in the city. He added the percentage of HIV-positive pregnant women in the city used to be about 1.4 till four years ago, which has now come down to 0.5. \"Also, infection due to blood transfusions is down from 0.8% to about 0.4% in the same period,'' he said. The MDACS now hopes that the sentinel surveillance by the National AIDS Control Organisation, which begins in October, will give a thumbs up to Mumbai's war against HIV. MDACS has realised that taking Mumbai from category A to category B for HIV prevalence remains a daunting task. Category A is defined as any district where the number of pregnant women testing positive at ante-natal clinics in high risk areas is over 1% in the last three years. For Mumbai to be counted as category B, the number of pregnant women testing positive at these centres should be less than 1%. \"Also, the city should have lesser number of hotspots like brothels,'' said a civic official. \"It will be at least a decade for Mumbai to make it category B,'' said the official.

A resident of the central suburbs, he proudly announces unlike many HIV-positive patients, he has never been bedridden by frequent bouts of illnesses. He credits his health to his family and hisemployer, the Indian Railways, who have been supportive ever since he was diagnosed with HIV while randomly donating blood at a donation camp way back in 1997. The unusual patient scaled another height three months back; he became the first HIV-positive person in Maharashtra to undergo a kidney transplant. In the stigma-ridden world of HIV/AIDS, 45-year-old Jha's story holds out hope for the two-million-plus Indians living with HIV. In Jha's case, his 64-year-old mother Sitara donated one of her kidneys to her first-born son. \"I just want to see my child living healthily next to me,\" she said over the phone from Benares. The transplant is a milestone of sorts. Not surprisingly then, Jha's nephrologist Dr M Bahadur, transplant surgeon Shailesh Raina and medical consultant Dr Om Srivasatava are ecstatic with his progress since the transplant was carried out at Jaslok Hospital last November 26. \"This is the first time in Maharashtra that a HIV-positive person has got a transplant. It needs experienced specialists to manage the patient carefully so as to ensure that his body doesn't reject the donor organ while ensuring that the HIV infection doesn't flare up,\" Bahadur, who has been treating Jha since 2006, said. Admitting that it had indeed been a challenge to handle a HIV-positive patient, Srivastava said that the right medical environment (as in a super-speciality hospital like Jaslok), right protocol and medicines were needed for such transplants. \"If the HIV-positive patient's CD4 count is adequate and his viral load is negative, then he can safely undergo a transplant,\" added the Jaslok doctors. Worldwide, too, transplants for HIV-positive patients are a relatively new concept. In 2004, the US reported about a 100-odd liver and kidney transplants for HIV-positive patients. The man himself is calm. \"My HIV status was detected in 1997 and my kidney failure in 2006.\" He was on dialysis for three years before doctors realised that transplant would be the only hope for him. \"In my 13 years with HIV, I took only 77 days of leave but I needed over three months of leave for the kidney transplant and the minor problems that cropped up after it,\" he said. Jha also believes that his employer, the Railways, played a great role in his \"healthy but HIV\" status. \"I have had access to antiretroviral drugs for the past 10 years. I was never discriminated against or passed up for promotion at my workplace. My dialysis would cost tens of thousands of rupees but the railways always paid up. They even paid for my transplant,\" added the father of two. Dr Harsh Jauhari, one of the seniormost nephrologists in the country, said that while a couple of HIV-positive patients had undergone transplants in India, little was chronicled about these special patients. \"There is a confidentially clause with HIV-positive patients that cannot be tampered with. So it is likely that we don't know about all the transplants that have taken place in this category. But there is no denying that these patients need specialised care,\" added the Delhi-based Jauhari. Another senior doctor said there were several issues about safety about the medical staff involved as well that had not allowed HIV-positive transplants so far. Incidentally, a study published in the Archives of Surgery last year by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said that HIV-positive kidney transplant recipients could have the same one-year survival rates for themselves and their donor organs as those without HIV, if certain risk factors for transplant failure were recognized and tightly managed. According to the report, \"HIV patients were earlier not considered transplant candidates as researchers thought that the survival rates after transplantation were greatly compromised by the disease, which cripples the body's immune system. Also, transplant patients take drugs that suppress their immune systems in order to prevent organ rejection, a regimen thought to further threaten their already fragile immune systems.\" (The patient's name has been changed.)"}

Thirty-five-year-old Shankar (name changed) met with an accident four years ago. While getting treatment for his injured leg, he contracted the deadly HIV-virus during a blood transfusion. Over a period of time, the blood clot in the leg began to spread to the heart and lungs. The pressure on the lungs began on show on the right side of the heart, which began to fail. Barring his wife, everyone in his family deserted him. \"When he came to us two weeks ago, he was almost bedridden. We conducted the Pulmonary Endarterectomy. Since he was HIV positive, we had to take extra precautions while conducting the surgery. We use nearly 100 needles and even if one gets infected, it is dangerous. But we decided to take on the challenge and operated him,\" Dr Devi Shetty, chief cardiac surgeon at Narayana Hrudayalaya told The Times of India. Narayana Hrudayalaya does the second largest number of this surgery in the world. \"The idea was to tell the world that it is safe to operate HIV patients too. There is no doubt that it is risky and extra precautions must be ensured during the surgery,\" Shetty said. IT IS RE-BIRTH FOR ME Many hospitals refused to treat me because I was carrying the deadly virus. No one even cared if I died. It was not my fault that I became HIV-positive. I was almost bedridden. Dr Shetty is like God to me. He has given me new life. All I want to say is that there is nothing to fear in life. Being HIV-positive is a different issue but other health problems need to be treated as well. Just have courage to fight... (he breaks down). HOW WAS IT DONE During the six-hour open heart surgery, the body temperature is reduced to 18 degree (the normal temperature is 37 degree). The surgery is conducted in circulatory arrest, where the patient's body is frozen and entire blood collected to a reservoir. According to Dr Shetty the entire operation is conducted when the body is bloodless. Post-surgery the blood is pumped back into the body and the temperture is restored to 37 degrees."}

One per cent of the city's 15,000 street children (in the age group of 5-14) are HIV-positive, but were not aware of the fact that they were carrying the deadly virus, reveals a survey conducted by the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED), Kolkata. Most victims did not even know how the disease got transmitted or its symptoms and had contracted the lethal virus through sexual abuse, says the survey. While around 4% suffered from other sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, nearly 10% of these youngsters faced sexual abuse before turning 16. Titled Non-tobacco Substance Use, Sexual Abuse, HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection Among Street Children in Kolkata', the study was carried out across 58 municipal wards of the city. More than 550 street children, who have no family, were interviewed and observed from 2007 to 2009. Random blood samples were collected to check the prevalence of diseases like HIV, hepatitis B and sexually transmitted diseases. The results have left the team of researchers shocked. \"One per cent of these children were HIV-positive which is a big number. Being marginalised and without any access to medical care, they will probably never come to know of their HIV status. Or, by the time they do, they will have infected others. This is an alarming situation since the urban homeless often act as a bridge between the infected population and those who are at risk. We need immediate intervention to check a potential epidemic,\" said Kamalesh Sarkar, deputy director, division of epidemiology, NICED. Sarkar led a five-member research team for the study. While no specific age of the HIV victims could be established from the random survey, all were below 16 years. Inquiring into the reasons behind the spread of the virus, the researchers found that most had faced sexual abuse. \"A minor percentage might have got the virus from sex workers. It is quite possible that they passed it on to others since both sexual abuse and promiscuity was common among street children. It is unlikely that any had got the virus from their parents,\" said Sarkar. The study reveals that while 26% of male street children faced sexual abuse before they turned 15, 13% of the girls who faced abuse were above 15 years. Around 13% of the boys who visited sex workers suffered from sexually transmitted diseases. \"Without any shelter or protection, these children will continue to be vulnerable. Moreover, they had no idea of HIV or that they could end up carrying the virus and infect others. Since there has never been any such study in the past, it is difficult to say if the number is rising. But unless steps are taken, it will definitely spiral and pose a serious health hazard which we are probably not ready to deal with,\" said Baishali Bal, one of the researchers. Less than half of the street children got two square meals a day, more than 85% slept in public places and earned less than Rs 1,000 a month. Substance abuse, the study disclosed, was extremely high among them. Thirty per cent used non-tobacco substances like adhesives, brown sugar, cocaine and alcohol. NICED has proposed shelters and support centres for street children at railway stations. \"It is at places like stations and markets that they generally tend to camp in search of work and food. We have written to the railway ministry to join hands with us for shelters at the stations,\" said Sarkar."}

This is demonstrated not only by the latest figures of the National Aids Control Organisation which show the prevalence in Tamil Nadu dropping from 0.5% in 2003 to 0.25% in 2007 in the case of general population and rising from 4% to 7% in the case of MSM but also by the findings of a survey conducted by Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education (YRGCARE). The survey, comprising a sample of 721 MSM from 18 different cities in the state, found 9% of MSM to be HIV-infected. \"The sustained campaign by the government about the use of condoms and its various awareness programmes for sex workers (the prevalence of HIV among them decreased from 9% in 2003 to 4.7% in 2007) and truck drivers have clearly shown results. But things remain unchanged as far as MSM and drug users are concerned,\" says Dr Sunil Suhas Solomon, senior medical officer and epidemiologist at YRGCARE, who presented the data at the 16th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Montreal last year. \"MSM remain a hidden population in India primarily due to Section 377 of the IPC, which has historically criminalised sex between men, and also the societal and family pressures to marry. Hence, there is very little community-level data of HIV among MSM. So we used a technique called peer-driven recruitment, which uses MSM to recruit other MSM to arrive at the study sample,\" says Dr Solomon. The study also documented the existence of HIV epidemics among MSM in many smaller cities such as Tirunelveli, Ramanathapuram and Tuticorin, which are usually not included in the planning of interventions targeted at MSM. Also, more interesting was the finding that the prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections among MSM who were married is double compared to MSM who were not married. \"About 35% of our sample of MSM were married. The higher prevalence of HIV infection among MSM who were married could partially be explained by their nature to keep their same sex practices even more hidden. Consequently, they ended up having more male partners, which has been shown by many studies to be a strong risk factor for HIV infection,\" explains Dr Solomon. Sahodaran, an organisation that works with MSM, conducted a similary survey recently in association with the Tuberculosis Research Centre in Chetpet and found that 8% of MSM in Chennai were HIV infected. But Sunil Menon, who runs Sahodaran, says there is no tangible evidence to back such figures because the gay community still remains hidden. \"Maybe the figure is shown rising just because more people are testing now than they did before. So there is no way of saying whether the prevalence is increasing, decreasing or remains the same,\" says Menon. Says Dr Solomon, \"The current phase of the National AIDS Control Programme has initiatives targeting MSM. Only time will tell the effectiveness of these programmes but the government needs to be applauded for the fact that it recognizes HIV among MSM as an issue and is taking steps to address it. However, it is equally important to address issues related to the families (wives and children) of these marginalised populations who are also being placed at risk via their spouses' behaviors.\""}

Proving to be an exception to this norm is Panambur beach near here. Reason, an unofficial ban on tobacco products, especially gutka! In force for the past month, this ban has worked due to an informal initiative taken by the Panambur Beach Development Project, which is officially vested with the rights to develop the beach.The way this ban works is simple. All beachfront snack and general kiosks do not store or sell gutka. Tourists unaware of this ban but carrying gutka on them are frisked. Gutka found on them is confiscated, shredded in front of them and thrown into the waste bin. An initial experiment of returning confiscated gutka to owners while leaving the beach proved to be logistical nightmare for project authorities, who promptly shelved the idea.Interestingly, the beach of holidays and weekends sees an influx of visitors - local and outsiders in thousands. Yet the beach is clean from gutka stains. The success in this regard, notes Yathish Bykampady, CEO of the project is the \"100 per cent strike rate\" of project employees in spotting persons likely to carry gutka on them. \"Usually, they are from a lower economic strata, and majority of them are from North India,\" he infers.Since the ban is informal, even punishments for violations of the ban are informal yet effective, Yathish told TOI. A person who chews gutka and spits it on the pristine sand is promptly made to clean the mess in front of the other tourists, he says. Does this evoke protests from the errant tourists? No, says Yathish. In fact, they have been receptive to the idea behind the ban, that is to keep the beach clean for all tourists concerned, he adds.Another reason in enforcing this ban, Yathish observes is a simple question of would any one like to see their children play on the sands covered with gutka stains. Beaches that are not clean will not attract tourists, says Giridhar Kamath, an intrepid kite flyer who frequents the beach. This is one facility that provides outdoor recreation facility for thousands, and the least one can do is to keep the beach premises clean, he adds. jaideep.shenoy@timesgroup.com"}

A collaborative research would be undertaken by the renowned scientist from the University and their counterparts from AU. The research would be initiated by professor Bechan Sharma, department of biochemistry, AU and prof Tobias Restle, Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Lubeck, Germany. The research work would be conducted for period of two months starting from mid May. Prof Sharma, while talking to TOI gave a detailed information about the research. He said, \" The joint efforts would be focused on investigating the new anti HIV-1 drug which has the potential to terminate the replication of the dreaded virus. Simultaneously, their joint endeavour would explore the molecular intricacies involved in the HIV-1 RT, the key enzyme responsible for generation of mutations in HIV-1 genome. The outcome of the research would enable the development of safe and cost effective anti HIV-1 drugs. Prof Sharma said that the existing drugs have certain shortcomings including high costs, side effects and toxicity that develop after prolonged usage of the drugs. As soon as the structural changes in the virus are identified, an effective antidote could be developed as precise understanding of the behaviour of the virus. This would enhance the future preparation of the drug. Detailing further about various interesting facts pertaining to this dreaded disease, Prof Sharma said that AIDS continues to spread unchecked since its first documentation in 1981. Two decades later, nearly 50 million individuals are living with HIV/AIDS world wide and approximately 25 million had died, according to figures released by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO). India shares 10 per cent of global HIV burden and 65 per cent of South-East Asian population. It is reported that 5.2 million HIV infections exist in India. The national HIV prevalence was between 0.4 and 1.3 percent HIV-1 in 2003."}

Later, she contracted HIV. Her initial reaction to the diagnosis was utter shock and much to her expectation, her life became a living hell. Deserted by all, she was leading a life of solitude and loneliness. There were many women like her in Bharatpur district who were facing similar experiences. Having contracted HIV after working as sex workers, they had no one to share their problems with and were totally down with stress and depression till they came across an intervention programme being run there by the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) and voluntary organisation Lupin Human Welfare & Research Foundation. Under this programme, a mass awareness programme was undertaken for HIV prevention and on the risk factors associated with HIV infection among the sex workers in the Bharatpur district. They were identified as a key factor for the spread of HIV. Then a strategic approach for confronting the crisis through safe sex by promotion of condom was initiated on a large-scale. Outlets were created in 11 hot spot areas where condom were freely available for the clients visiting them. In the past one year, 302 sex workers of Bedia community were registered for target intervention. The foundation ensured that the stigma and rejection of such women is stopped by education and creating an awareness, advocacy and sensitisation. Drop-in centres were established for a one-to-one meeting of all such sex workers to discuss their problems and share information of mutual interest. Women were encouraged to form self-help groups to facilitate them to join the mainstream of development activities and to spread awareness amongst their community on HIV prevention. Provision for clean drinking water, hut insurance coverage, training for income generation activities like manufacturing of \u2018Tulsi malas\u2019 etc were also conducted for their benefit. Various health camps were organised at the hot spots to encourage HIV testing at voluntary counselling and testing centres in government hospitals. It was ensured that women suffering from sexually-transmitted infections are treated at private clinics, where the doctors and staff have been specially trained for handling them. The medicine at these clinics were distributed free of cost."}

In defiance of the services being provided to PLHA under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, any verbal or written complaint can likely lead to severe punishment to the hospital staff in both government and private sector hospitals. In an official letter issued by the principal secretary, Pradeep Shukla to all the chief medical officer and principal of the medical colleges of the state, attention has been drawn towards directives to enhance the extent and efficacy of the treatment administered to PLHA's. Mentioning that many times, cases are reported where medical staff in rural areas refuse to provide treatment to the HIV patients after they are detected HIV positive, the chief medical officer Dr Ashok Mishra informed that for the comprehensive care of PLHA's at ART centre, all doctors, nurses and hospital staff, whether in public sector or in private sector should treat PLHA's in a professional and humane manner, always with dignity and care. \"No doctors and nurses shall refuse to treat a PLHA on account of his/her positive status. In treating a PLHA, there shall be no discrimination or stigma whatsoever,\" he said. Giving an instance, CMO said, \"doctors and nurses create stigma at the time of the delivery of an HIV positive pregnant females especially in the rural areas. Thus, keeping in view of such practices, the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has a provision of post exposure prophylaxis wherein any doctor or paramedical staff getting in contact with the blood or other fluid of an HIV patient, will be provided anti retro viral medicine free of cost for the sake of safety.\" But it is the irony that many a times PLHA's are not being treated in humane manner, instead they are discriminated from the treatment as well as society. Thus, to make the doctors and ART centres aware of their responsibilities, an attempt has been initiated to provide better health care facilities to the diseased. Besides, government hospitals, directives have been issued to doctors in the private sectors to get themselves familiarise with the NACO's comprehensive protocol and policies with regard to care and treatment. \"Generally there are private practitioners who take advantage of the illiteracy and poverty of those suffering with HIV/AIDS by prescribing wrong or unnecessary regimes of drugs or charge an exorbitant amount,\" said deputy chief medical officer, Dr Rajesh Jha. \"Such practices can be tackled only with the help of health associations like Indian Medical Association, Surgeons of India, Indian Academy of Paediatrics and others,\" he said. \"Strict actions has to be taken against the irrational prescription of ART. While all the advertisements offering potential cure for HIV must be banned and such organisations must be dealt strictly, as there is no proven cure available for HIV/AIDS,\" he added."}

The hospital, however, refuted the allegations and said she had been treated there twice earlier. Goregaon resident Ayesha (name changed) was admitted to the medical ward of G T Hospital around 11 am on Tuesday. However, she was discharged within half-an-hour and asked to go to surgical department. Ayesha alleged that first, she got admitted to the hospital only after waiting in the rain for 5 hours and intervention by senior doctors. Secondly, she claimed that, instead of discharging her, the doctors could have simply transferred her papers from one department to another (surgery). What upset her the most was that a resident medical officer allegedly told her that her HIV-positive status could pose a problem for both patients and doctors. She also claimed that she was forcefully handed over the Discharge Against Medical Advice (DAMA) papers. \"There is an abscess in my neck that has to be operated upon but doctors want me to go to some other hospital. They are worried that the HIV may pass on to others,\" Ayesha said. Later in the evening, social workers shifted her to St George Hospital. It's been two years now that she has been living with HIV, while her husband succumbed to the same ailment seven months ago. The hospital, however, claimed that the issue was blown out of proportion by social workers. \"The patient had sought discharge against doctors' advice,\" said Dr A P Chaudhari, medical superintendent of G T Hospital. \"She was admitted to the wrong ward and I had asked my doctors to take her to the casualty and admit her again.

The antiretroviral regimen for treating the mothers is much more expensive and requires access to medical facilities that aren't widely available in developing countries such as Malawi, The baby regimen, in comparison, is incredibly cheap and much easier to implement. These findings are important because each year about 200,000 infants worldwide become infected with HIV through breastfeeding, and in the developing world infant formula is both prohibitively expensive and associated with increased infant deaths,\" the study's author Charles van der Horst said. In the study, 2,369 breastfeeding mother-infant pairs in Malawi, were randomly assigned to one of three groups -- a maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) group, a second group in which infants were treated with nevirapine liquid and control group for whom medications were given at the time of delivery only. None of these women had developed AIDS yet and thus did not need treatment for their own health. After their babies were born, women in the maternal antiretroviral group received a single tablet twice a day containing the drugs zidovudine and lamivudine.

The team's target is reaching out to 10,000 people in a day. And no, they are not afraid of being molested. \"Crowded places mean we will have police protection and nobody will mess with us. I have seen a lot of videos of similar campaigns elsewhere in the world and nobody has ever acted up. So I am not afraid of people misbehaving,\" she says.

However, Raj Shree Behra, in-charge of Umaid Hospital's blood bank, said there is no way to reduce to zero the window period, that is the time taken for seroconversion after exposure to the HIV virus. Seroconversion is the development of detectable antibodies in blood to fight an infectious agent. It normally takes some time for antibodies to develop after the initial exposure to an infection. If infected blood has been taken from any donor before the formation of detectable antibodies, there is no technology which can detect them in the stored blood at any point of time, said Behra. Antibodies will develop only when the infected blood is given to any other person. Currently, ELISA test has a longer window period disabling it to detect any antibody at early stage in the donated blood. It is certified by National AIDS Control Organisation."}

Reason: the residents welfare association has taken objection to their medical condition and ordered them to leave, with the alleged aid of local police. The apartment located in HUDA complex, Saroor Nagar is owned by a social worker, B S H Prasad and acts as a shelter for HIV positive people who are trying to lead a normal life. The home currently houses three students enrolled in leading professional colleges in the city and a lecturer of a private junior college in Guntur. According to the owner of the apartment, trouble started when the president of the residents welfare association, Srilatha, chanced upon posters on HIV awareness inside the apartment, where the four lived, around two weeks ago. She spread the word among the neighbours and in the enquiries which ensued, two of the four residents of the flat revealed their medical condition. Following this, the resident welfare association threatened the students and asked them to vacate.

Sources said in the second quarter, after a total of 800 TB patients, who never had undergone for HIV testing were checked, and 11 were found HIV positive. The integrated package had been started on April 1 where all the TB patients coming for the sputum tests were given the voluntary counselling on HIV and were motivated to go for the testing at the integrated counselling and testing centres. Till now, the district health department did not have the data regarding the number of TB patients suffering from HIV. While giving the information, one of the officials of the health department said that under this program counselling would be given at the integrated centre, and, if the TB patient agrees to go for the test and turns positive for HIV, then he/she will be given antiretroviral drugs free. At present, more than 500 TB patients are coming only in civil hospital for the sputum tests. On the condition of anonymity, one of the staff members of the ICTC Centre said that mostly people who were suffering from TB were at higher risk of getting the infection but due to the lack of awareness they did not come for the voluntary tests and patients themselves were not aware that they were suffering from HIV. While giving the information, district TB officer Ashish Chawla said that this had been started with the aim to create awareness among the TB patients and to check the incidence among the TB patients as with this it was clear that almost 1% of the patients suffering from TB were suffering from HIV. Dr Chawla added that along with the status of HIV patients, it would be helpful to provide them treatment after checking the patients and would be helpful in deciding the follow-up treatment."}

Till recently, paediatricians in India, on detection of anti-HIV antibodies in children below 18 months, could never tell for sure whether they were already infected or the antibodies were transferred to them from their mother. Therefore, doctors couldn't even start the life-saving Anti-Retroviral Treatment -- the only effective way to treat HIV -- on them. This, according to National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), led to 33,000 new infants getting the infection every year from their HIV positive mothers. India, in March, rolled out the highly accurate DNA PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test in the four high prevalence states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. Available in 767 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) and 180 ART centres, the DNA PCR can test the blood sample of a child after it reaches six weeks of age and accurately say whether it is already infected with HIV or not. The antibody test available before March could only confirm the HIV status after the child reached 18 months of age. In the last three months, 45 children have been tested for HIV status. NACO hopes to roll out the test to 10,000 children born to HIV positive mothers by March next year. \"As soon as the child of an HIV positive mother is older than six weeks, his or her blood sample is collected and transported to seven national labs for testing with DNA PCR which gives us a definitive diagnosis on the child's HIV status. The report is available in just a week,\" NACO's ART chief Dr B B Rewari told TOI before leaving for the International AIDS Conference in Vienna. Dr Rewari, who will present this data in Vienna, added, \"Usually, if such children aren't put on treatment, 50% of them die within the first year of birth if infected. So early diagnosis and treatment is vital.\" Till now, India has detected 19,000 children with HIV. Unlike other tests, the HIV DNA PCR test does not rely on the presence of antigens or antibodies in the blood for diagnosis. Instead, it identifies genetic material by highlighting sequences of the virus within the subject's DNA. Experts say all babies born to mothers with HIV are born with HIV antibodies. Babies who are not infected lose their antibodies by the time they are about 18 months old. However, most babies can be diagnosed as either infected or uninfected by the time they are three months old by using DNA PCR test. \"The PCR test is more sensitive than the HIV test, and is not used in the standard HIV testing of adults. It looks for the presence of HIV itself, not antibodies,\" a NACO official said. When a woman is tested HIV positive, she is offered special medical care to reduce the risk of her baby being infected. Some pregnant women with HIV decide to have their baby. Others choose to have a termination. \"There are now very effective drugs that can reduce the risk of an HIV positive mother passing the virus to her baby in the womb or at birth. Delivery by elective Caesarean section also reduces the risk of a baby becoming infected. Beast-feeding in such cases increases the risk of the baby becoming infected,\" the official said. * An estimated 22.7 lakh Indians are infected with HIV * India has an HIV prevalence of 0.29% * It usually takes 10 years for HIV to become full blown AIDS * The first AIDS case in India was reported from Chennai, in 1986 * Globally, more than 33 million people have AIDS or HIV, half of them women * Since the beginning of the epidemic in 1981, 60 million people have got infected with HIV and at least 25 million have died of AIDS"}

According to latest WHO figures, an estimated 5.2 million HIV patients were receiving this life-saving treatment at the end of 2009. India is among the top 20 countries, which recorded the highest percentage increase in the number of people receiving ART between 2007 and 2008. Over this one year, there was a spurt in 48% of patients -- from 1.50 lakh to 2.34 lakh -- who could receive ART. The number of facilities with HIV testing and counselling in the country has also increased from 4,269 in 2007 to 4,817 in 2008. Since 2003, the number of people receiving HIV treatment has increased 12-fold globally. The cost needed for HIV treatment this year is pegged around $ 9 billion, according to UNAIDS. However, the future for the global fight against AIDS does not seem too bright, financially. A new report, released at the International Aids Conference in Vienna on Monday, says that donor nation support for AIDS relief was flat in 2009, thanks to the global meltdown, with only $7.6 billion provided during the year, ending the run of annual double-digit percentage point increases in donor support for international AIDS assistance since 2002 when donor governments provided a total of $1.2 billion. America remained the largest donor nation in the world, accounting for more than half (58%) of last year's disbursements, followed by the United Kingdom (10.2%), Germany (5.2%), the Netherlands (5%) and France (4.4%). \"Reductions in investment on AIDS programs are hurting the AIDS response. At a time, when we are seeing results in HIV prevention and treatment, we must scale up, not scale down,\" said Michel Sidibi, UNAIDS executive director. UNAIDS estimates that $23.6 billion was needed to address the epidemic in low-and middle-income countries in 2009. That suggests a growing gap of $7.7 billion between available resources and the need. Though the financial deficit comes as a cause for concern, Dr Hiroki Nakatani -- WHO's assistant director-general for HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases -- has praised global efforts to put more and more patients on life-saving HIV drugs. \"The 1.2 million is the largest increase in people accessing treatment in a single year. It is an extremely encouraging development,\" he said. At the International AIDS Conference, WHO is calling for timely treatment for HIV patients. The basic objective is to begin treatment before they take ill because of weakened immunity. \"Starting treatment earlier gives us an opportunity to enable people living with HIV to stay healthier and live longer,\" says Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, WHO, director, HIV/AIDS. Estimates developed through epidemiological modeling suggest that HIV-related mortality can be reduced by 20% between 2010 and 2015 if these guidelines for early treatment are implemented. Earlier treatment can prevent opportunistic infections including tuberculosis -- the number one killer blow for HIV patients. Deaths from TB can be reduced by as much as 90%, if both HIV and TB patients are treated earlier. \"In addition to saving lives, earlier treatment has also prevention benefits,\" Dr Hirnschall says. \"Because treatment reduces the level of virus in the body, it means HIV-positive people are less likely to pass the virus on to their partners.\" WHO's treatment guidelines expand the number of people recommended for HIV treatment from an estimated 10 million to 15 million. Bernhard Schwartlander, director, evidence, strategy and results, UNAIDS, said, \"People with weaker immune systems who come late for treatment require more complex and costly drugs and services than those who start treatment earlier and are healthier.\" Asia's fight against AIDS * Number of HIV patients in 2008 was 4.7 million against 4.5 million in 2001 * Number of new HIV infections in 2008 was 3.5 lakh against 4 lakh in 2001 * Number of newly-infected children in 2008 was 21,000 against 33,000 in 2001 * Number of AIDS-related deaths in 2008 was 3.3 lakh against 2.8 lakh in 2001 * Asia is home to 60% of the world's population. But, it is second only to sub-Saharan Africa as far as HIV patients is concerned * India accounts for almost half of Asia's HIV prevalence * Only 37% of HIV patients in Asia, who require ART were getting it in 2008, which is below the global average of 42%"}

On Tuesday, scientists announced at the International Aids Conference in Vienna that they have successfully tested a gel, containing antiretroviral drug Tenofovir, which is usually taken as a tablet by HIV patients. The drug can reduce a woman's chances of contracting HIV from an infected partner by 50% if used 12 hours before and after having sex. Interestingly, the gel had undergone a safety and acceptability trial on 100 women at National Aids Research Institute (NARI) in Pune in 2007. It can also reduce the risk of genital herpes by 51%. Being hailed as a major breakthrough globally, the CAPRISA trial followed 900 HIV-negative, sexually active South African women in the age group between 18 and 40. Two-and-a-half-years on, researchers found the gel reduced chances of HIV infection by 50% after a year and 39% after 30 months. The study revealed that those women -- who used the drug consistently nearly 80% of the time before having sex -- would be 54% less prone to infection. Health secretary K Sujatha Rao told TOI \"This is a major breakthrough, and will especially benefit India's 300,000-strong sex worker community involved in multi-partner sex. It will also help women who usually do not have the power to insist on condom use and fidelity, or to abandon partnerships that put them at high risk.\" K Chandramouli, director general of National Aids Control Organisation. added, \"At present, India has 2.7 million HIV patients. We also record 1.7 lakh fresh cases of HIV every year, nearly 40% of which are women. Such a microbicide, once ready for implementation in our programme, will greatly benefit women.\" According to NARI director Dr R S Paranjape, the gel underwent safety and acceptability study in India as well. \"The preparatory work for the CAPRISA trial was conducted here along with the Microbicide Trials Network. The overall safety profile of the gel was good and it was well accepted by women. Presently, it provides 40% protection. The scientific community will now look at increasing this percentage,\" he explained. With a vaccine against HIV remaining elusive, scientists have for the past 20 years been looking for such an effective microbicide -- products such as gels, films, rings or creams that women could apply on their vagina to prevent HIV transmission. Finally, the breakthrough has happened, thanks to the microbicide that contains 1% Tenofovir. Tenofovir gel is an advanced second-generation HIV-specific microbicide that neither tries to kill the AIDS virus nor block it from entering the body as its predecessors. Instead, it is designed to prevent the virus from replicating when it comes in contact with an uninfected T-cell. Naturally, the virus will fail to survive for long to cause systemic infection. Women, who constitute 50% all new HIV cases globally, are also twice as likely as their male partners to contract HIV during unsafe sex. \"Tenofovir gel could fill an important HIV prevention gap by empowering women who are unable to successfully negotiate mutual faithfulness or condom use with their male partners,\" said study co- principal investigator Dr Quarraisha Abdool Karim. \"Eleven trials in the past 15 years have shown no change or even sometimes an increase in transmission rates. Tenofovir gel has a potential dual effect in preventing HIV. Since women with genital herpes are much more likely to become infected with HIV, the additional protection of tenofovir gel against herpes creates a second mechanism whereby the gel may have a bigger impact in preventing HIV,\" he explained. The gel is undergoing another Microbicide Trials Networks VOICE -- Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic -- study that will provide evidence about the safety and efficacy of tenofovir gel used daily, irrespective of when participants have sex. Once this study is conducted, drug regulatory authorities will determine if the gel is safe and effective for HIV prevention. It may take another two years before public can use it. Michel Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS, said, \"For the first time, we have seen results for a woman-initiated and controlled HIV prevention option.\""}

With no adverse reactions reported so far, the first phase of the trial is set for completion this year before the second phase rolls out early 2011. The scientists are eagerly awaiting to see how the vaccine, now with a new component, would boost the immunity of 32 healthy volunteers in a low-risk group. A 2008 trial at TRC had proved to be equally safe, but the immunity boosting capacity had not met the desired requirement. Once the strength of the vaccine is established in the current round, the trial will move on to the second phase which involves a larger group of volunteers for three years, and then on to the third phase where the vaccine would also be tested on a high-risk segment. The 18-month trial began in 2009 with 16 volunteers in each centre. The groups were further divided into two for a double blind' study. While one group was given injections thrice, the other was given injections four times. One of this was a placebo, the other the vaccine. Neither the volunteers nor the scientists knew which group received the vaccine. Lessons from the earlier round of clinical trials carried out by TRC in August 2008 have come handy this time. \"It was significant because the vaccine passed the safety test. Yet, it was not as strong as we expected it to be,\" said study's principal investigator Dr V R Ramanathan, senior deputy director, TRC. The scientists then evolved a strategy to boost the immune response and added another vaccine candidate called the DNA vaccine, which was tried by scientists in the USA. \"We hope this combination will yield better results. All the volunteers received the injections in the first six months. They were asked to come on the 9th, 12th and 18th month for follow-up. We have completed the 12th month follow-up. So far, we have not seen any toxic reactions,\" said NARI director Dr RS Paranjape. \"The last visit for follow-up will be in December. We will then unblind' the study and the results will be available by February,\" he added. Scientists admit that it would take a long time and a lot of testing before the vaccine can be considered for use. \"Phase -2 is only a larger study with a sample size that may extend up to 500. This will take at least three years. The vaccine will then be upgraded for the next level of trial, where volunteers from high-risk groups will also participate. This is where we would know if the vaccine is really efficient in stopping the virus from entering the body,\" said Dr Ramanathan. Of the 33.4 million people living with HIV/AIDS in the world, 2.7 million are in India. Though the prevalence in India is less than 0.3%, 1.7 lakh fresh cases being reported every year remains a matter of concern. pushpa.narayan@timesgroup.com"}

Concerned by the trend, the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TNSACS) is organising a youth carnival to create awareness and promote safe sex. The state has been boasting about a decline of infection in the population, but those working in the HIV/AIDS sector fear that there is an increase in the incidence of the disease. A recent analysis undertaken by TNSACS has shown that the profiles of the newly infected people were not from the high risk groups. \"Instead they were housewives, single working people and students. We also did a study on usage of condoms among youth. That's when we found that many have occasional unprotected intercourse with multiple partners,\" said Dr. S.Thennarasu, the regional coordinator. Other senior officals in TNSAC confirmed the trend. \"The infection rate is high only within the age-group of 15-29 years. Today, casual sex has a fair amount of social acceptance. Mobility amidst both sexes is on the rise,\" the official added. Others working in the sector agree. \"There is a clear decline in the HIV prevalence rates among sex workers and truckers. In a small study we found that casual sex among working professionals particularly those in garment industry and the BPO sector was high.\" said Dr R Lakshmibai, the project director of TAI. As per data furnished by the TNSAC, the prevalence of HIV among commercial sex workers had decreased from 8.8% in 2003 to 3.6% in 2007. Consequently, even prevalence of other Sexually Transmitted Diseases(STD) had decreased from 16.8% in 2000 to 8% in 2007. However, the state registered a total of 28,000 cases in 2008-09 and 30,000 new cases in 2009-10. \"There were only basic awareness programs conducted for the general population. Otherwise, we focused only on target groups. It's probably time to change that,\" said an official. TNSACS, in association with APAC and TAI will organise a youth carnival in August that will attempt to sensitise them to the dangers of unsafe sex with strangers. \"Intercourses with multiple partners is always risky,\" explained Dr Bimal Charles, project director of Aids Prevention and Control Project (APAC). \"And the youth are always prone to experimentation. If they are not aware of safety, it increases the risk.\" The Carnival will attempt to create awareness through mediums the youth relate to, like video and short film competitions on the issue, workshops, jingles and jazzy numbers. \"Already, the few interactions that we had with the youth helped us realise that they were hungry for information on this topic.\""}

A couple of days back, an inspection was conducted at Civil Hospital by NACO officials in the city. In the inspection, along with the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre, blood bank was checked. It was decided to start the oral substitution therapy for intravenous drug users (IDU). Under this programme, oral medicines would be given to all drug users to help them kick the habit. This would also help in reducing the risk of HIV transmission from one intravenous drug user to another. Needles are a predominant mode of spread of HIV. And addicts often stop caring about sharing of needles, resulting in a higher risk of contracting HIV. A few weeks back, a study was conducted by an NGO Rising Youth, wherein it was revealed 75% truck drivers visit commercial sex workers and syringes are commonly used by them.

An ongoing study by the KEM Hospital to find out the efficacy of ayurvedic drugs in improving the life expectancy of HIV positive patients has yielded some positive results. The medicine department of the hospital has been studying the potency of an ayurvedic drug on 700 HIV patients since April last year. After little more than a year, the institute found a significant boost in the count of CD4 cells in these patients, and also that it could probably push the initiation of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), known to have many side-effects, by a few years. The count of CD4 cells is directly proportional to the health of a person for these cells are the most important part of one's immune system. Anyone with less CD4 count is more prone to ailments as the body's defence mechanism starts giving way. The ART for HIV patients is started only after the CD4 count falls below 250. After administering the ayurvedic drug, the doctors found that the CD4 count in patients on an average went up from 448 to 546 within six months and up to 590 in a year's time. Besides, many patients had weight gains, increase in haemoglobin count and a sense of well-being. Claiming that it spells a lot of promise, head of medicine at KEM Hospital Dr A R Pazare said that not every patient who tests positive for HIV immediately qualifies for the ART drugs. \"Till a patient's CD4 count comes down to 250, we cannot prescribe ART. But patients show apprehension to go back home without medicines, especially after they are found positive for such a dreaded ailment,'' he said. Moreover, ART has side-effects like pain in abdomen, weakening of limbs and arms, swollen abdomen and distortion of facial features. Therefore, Pazare believes that patients could be prescribed some ayurvedic drugs with immuno-restorative properties that can delay the initiation of ART. \"Our assumption is that ayurvedic drugs with properties to strengthen immunity can delay the ART therapy by at least four years,'' said Pazare. \"And later, as the patient is put on ART, he can survive for a few more decades,'' he added. The KEM hospital study will be on for the next five years. However, the study solely focused on CD4 cells and did not check if the drug could bring down the viral load in a patient. Another hitch remains that ayurvedic drugs cannot be consumed simultaneously with the ART drugs. Speaking on the use of alternative therapies, head of ART department of JJ Hospital Dr Alaka Deshpande said nations across the globe were looking for indigenous medicines for HIV. \"Even in India, more systematic studies are required as there is no standardised data that talks about long-term effects,'' she said. Yet, she added that it may not be a bad idea to put patients on ayurvedic medicines with proven benefits till they are ideal candidates for ART."}

In 1995, he applied for a work visa, forking out Rs 20,000 to an agent in Mumbai. A mandatory medical check followed and all the doctor would tell him was that \"something is wrong\" with his blood test results. He offered however to help suppress information for a \"commission\" of Rs 2,000. The expenses cost Harjeet a loan but he managed to fly to Saudi Arabia. On arrival, he was subjected to another medical test. To his shock, he was soon after whisked away to an isolated cell and jailed there for a day. The next day he was taken to a court which ordered his deportation. Harjeet, it seems, had tested HIV-positive . Back in India, Harjeet found that his wife had walked out of the family home with their two children. He was packed off to a care centre and left alone to deal with his situation. Severely depressed, Harjeet began getting multiple seizures that left him partially paralysed . He eventually recovered with a lot of support from the care centre. Today, Harjeet works with people who are HIV-positive and his life story has been documented by the International Aids Society (IAS). Harjeet is not alone. Thousands of people across the world have been deported or denied entry into countries because they are HIV-positive . This is despite the fact that stigmatising HIV-positive individuals is contrary to effective public health programming. Official data shows that 66 countries, territories and areas deny entry, stay or residence to HIV-positive individuals: of these, 26 deport migrants who test positive, seven refuse permission to stay beyond a certain time bar and six deny entry even for very short-term stay. \"It is incomprehensible that HIV-related entry and residency restrictions still exist,\" says Kevin Moody, International Coordinator and CEO, Global Network of People Living with HIV. \"These restrictions are in blatant violation of human rights, they stimulate stigma and discrimination and actually hurt the response to the HIV epidemic.\" India's health secretary, K Sujatha Rao, believes that irrational discriminatory laws should be lifted. \"In India, we don't have any laws against residence or visit by HIV patient,\" she points out. Many of these restrictions, says the IAS, were imposed in the early days of the epidemic, when there was a great deal of ignorance, fear and prejudice surrounding the subject. At that time, many governments saw these laws as an attempt to \"protect the public health\" and avoid the potential costs of care. The situation has, however, changed dramatically. There is a lot of information available about the disease and its prevention and the antiretroviral treatment can extend the life span of those who are HIV positive. Dr Helene Gayle, chief advisor to US president Barack Obama on HIV/AIDS, points out that these restrictive laws are no longer justified by concerns about public health. \"Over 60 countries around the world have a variety of HIV-specific laws that restrict the entry, stay or residence of people living with HIV including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Qatar, Oman, Russia, Colombia , South Korea, Yemen and Armenia ,\" says Dr Gayle. According to IAS executive director Craig McClure, scientific evidence shows that travel restrictions against those who are HIV-infected make for ineffective prevention tools. \"These laws are not consistent with current scientific knowledge, best practices in public health and humanitarian principles. They sustain a culture of exclusion, rights violations and marginalisation that impedes an effective response to the epidemic,\" says McClure. A WHO statement points out that such entry restrictions actually pressurise people into concealing their HIV infection from immigration authorities. They simply do not carry their HIV medicines on international trips. This could lead to drug-resistant HIV strains that are transmissible to other people. \"Furthermore, because drug resistance allows HIV to replicate in the body more freely, people with higher viral loads are also more infectious,\" says the statement. In the Asia and the Pacific region, countries have different kinds of restrictive laws for the HIV-affected . Singapore has an outright ban on all HIV-positive non-nationals for entry and immigration. Brunei targets HIV-positive foreigners for deportation. Australia requires HIV testing for permanent visa applicants over the age of 15. South Korea announced changes to its entry and immigration policy on January 1, 2010, but clarifications on its amended laws are still unclear. Some countries ask applicants to indicate their HIV status, some seek confirmation of HIV-negative test results and others insist on testing as a part of a mandatory medical exam for those seeking work permits. Things are however changing. The US, China and Namibia recently lifted their decades old travel laws against HIV-positive people. Hopefully, others will follow suit,and soon."}

So, even though it took her some time, this 28-year-old woman, who is HIV positive as is her six-year-old daughter, managed to convince the villagers of Longe, Kolhapur, that neither she nor her daughter are a threat to society. This August, the Longe gram panchayat \"respectfully requested her to return as an anganwadi worker and allowed her daughter to attend the village school.\" The woman told TOI, \"I am relieved that I can live with dignity. This is an important win.\" It all started in early 2009. Sanjeevani Kulkarni, founder-president of NGO Prayas, that works for the uplift and fair treatment of the HIV-affected, narrated the woman's story. \"Her husband was first detected with HIV in early 2009 at the village primary healthcare centre. She too underwent the test. Both the woman and her daughter tested positive, though her older son did not,\" she said. \" When the villagers came to know their status, they were not uncooperative. They helped the family in many ways.\" Eventually, the woman's husband passed away in late 2009. Though she continued to be in good health several eyebrows were raised at the fact that she was an anganwadi sevika. \"Parents were worried that her proximity to their children would prove detrimental to their health and well-being and that her little daughter would pass on the infection to other children in the village school. Now these worries are neither scientific nor logical. Nevertheless, she was asked to stay home with the promise that her salary would be sent to her. Her daughter was denied admission to the school. When this state of existence was unacceptable to her, the woman left the village with her children,\" Kulkarni said. She went to Mumbai this June and got in touch with the media, as well as various NGOs that work for the HIV positive. Her voice was heard and gradually the wheels of hope began spinning once again, especially when tehsildar Vijaya Jadhav got to know of the situation. A meeting with the gram sabha of Longe village was initiated. Officials from the district HIV programme, various NGOs like the Network of Positive People, Lotus Medical Foundation, Red Cross Society, Sakhi Sanghatan and Jeevan Jyot, as well as members of the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society were present. At the meeting, Sanjeevani Kulkarni and Pravin Naik, district HIV programme officer, Kolhapur, put to rest every niggling suspicion and query in the villagers' mind. \"The meeting lasted for over two hours, and we were successful in convincing the villagers that the woman and her child were far from being a threat,\" said Kulkarni. \"The villagers promised to look after her and her daughter in every way.\" Drupada Kumhare, sarpanch of Longe, said, \"We are convinced that there is no way that one can get infected with HIV just by coexisting with a positive person.\" Deputy sarpanch Subhash Patil said, \"We were afraid that our children could get infected if her daughter would play with them. But now we know that there is no such chance.\" A village-level committee comprising the sarpanch, deputy sarpanch as well as members of the village conflict redressal committee will support the woman. \"She is in good health. And so far, there has been no need for anti-retroviral therapy for her,\" added Kulkarni."}

To better understand the process by which HIV is transmitted, experts compared the gene encoding the major surface protein of HIV in semen and blood. \"In some men, the virus population in semen was similar to that in the blood, suggesting that virus was being imported from the blood into the genital tract and not being generated locally in the genital tract. \"We found two mechanisms that significantly altered the virus population in the semen, showing that virus can grow in the seminal tract in two different ways,\" Ronald Swanstrom of North Carolina University, who led the team, said. In one way, one or more viruses grow rapidly in the seminal tract over a short period such that the viral population in semen is homogeneous as compared to the population in the blood. In the other way, the virus replicates in T cells in the seminal tract over a long period, creating a separate population of virus in semen that is distinct from the blood virus."}

But their systems have been battling the deadly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) right from birth. Sneha Care Home makes all efforts to ensure their dreams are not crippled. Though HIV is an increasingly thriving menace in our society, little thought is spared for children who suffer after their parents fall victim to it. For no fault of their's, they are left to face the extreme bitterness of living with the disease. With treatment options expanding, issues about their future get more complex. Sneha Care Home (SCH) stepped in to address these issues. Started on July 14, 2008, SCH and Shining Star School address multiple issues of children infected with HIV, as well as prepare them for a productive and constructive life. \"Now with treatment options increasing dramatically, the life span of HIV-infected has also gone up, making us think of their future too,\" says Fr Mathew Perumpil, director of Sneha Care Home. \"When they grow up and become sexually active, they become potentially dangerous in transmitting the virus. Initially, we used to send our children to nearby schools. Once a teacher in the school noticed one of our boys growing intimate with a girl from his class and alerted us. We were totally unprepared to handle such a situation. That is when we started this new venture with 20 children where they are given value-based education,\" he adds. Now SCH houses 83 children who are below 12 years of age, including 34 girls. Most of them were orphaned due to the deadly HIV and many are with single parent. \"We choose kids from houses where the environment is not conducive for their healthy growth. We take away the burden of bringing up the children from suffering families,\" says Perumpil. Children are educated at the Shining Star School on their premises which ensures a good value system. The school, based on National Open School Curriculum, focuses on encouraging creativity and auditing the aptitude of these children. \"We want them to enter a good profession which is less physically taxing and that will define their self-esteem to live a life full of hope and meaning,\" says Perumpil. The tiny bundles of energy who run around here prove these points. With a smile on their lips and stars in their eyes, they are surging ahead in life. Ten-year-old Varalakshmi wants to become a nurse when she grows up. Ask her why: \"I want to take care of others,\" she quips. Puneet Kumar, 11, wants to be a farmer and is already willing to look after the vegetable garden at SCH. To ensure that these kids don't miss anything in life, SCH sends them to foster homes for holidays. \"We identify and screen the family before sending the children,\" says Perumpil. With all the care and affection from SCH, these children are better equipped to face their future with a smile."}

With no medical treatment or hope of life, HIV positive children had little to look forward to. But more than two decades after the deadly disease was first detected in Chennai, several babies now have a chance of survival into adulthood thanks to medical regimen and better nutrition. When the Indian government began the national Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) for HIV patients in 2004, the programme was a godsend to many infected patients who had even given up on the idea of survival. \"Before the ART programme began, morbidity and mortality rate for HIV positive patients were high,\" says Dr P Manorama, chairperson of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), who runs a home for HIV positive children in Chennai. Today, mortality levels have significantly reduced, from 13 % in 2005 to 8 % in 2010, according to the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS). But all the medical and financial aid given by the government is not enough to offset the need for emotional support for the patients, especially children infected with HIV. According to statistics furnished by TANSACS, there are 11,197 children living with HIV in the state today and a sizeable number among them are adolescents. Daisy David of World Vision, an NGO working with HIV positive teenagers, says there is a large segment of children born with the disease, who have today reached their adolescence. \"Children living with HIV have the same exposure to society and media as other children,\" she points out. \"They too grow up with ambitions and desires. However, the discussions provided by the government are inadequate. They not only need counseling on career ambitions and how to battle life on the professional front, but also on the changes their bodies undergo and their own desires regarding sex, marriage and companionship.\" Counselling HIV teenagers about marriage and companionship is rather difficult. \"There is need for counsellors who are equipped to handle all kinds of issues and emotions,\" says Dr.Lakshmibai, project director for Tamil Nadu Aids Initiative (TAI). \"Many of them would like to marry non-infected persons, so there is always the issue of acceptance and rejection,\" says Daisy, who had recently attended a workshop for HIV-infected adolescents in Manipur. \"At Manipur, I met a teenaged boy who was battling rejection after his girlfriend found out he was HIV positive. They all had questions as to whether they could have sexual intercourse with non-infected persons, whether the babies born out of such a bonding would also be infected. The very fact that they needed to ask these questions shows that they are not receiving this kind of information or counselling.\" The other issue that social workers stress on is a tailor-made counselling program for drug adherence. According to statistics furnished by the TNSAC, until June 2010, 3,298 people had not returned to their respective ART centres for their regular treatment for a period of one to three months. And 1,192 persons had not returned to the ART centres for treatment in a period of one to three months."}

This shocking incident happened at Rao's English medium private school in Vidyuthnagar area in Anantapur on Tuesday. Angry parents forced the school management to send her out after photographs of her HIV-positive mother and stepfather were splashed in local media a few days ago. Though no medical tests had confirmed that the girl was HIV-positive, the irate parents, who have been staging protests outside the school, forcibly took the girl to a private clinic where the staff refused to conduct medical tests on her. Later, they took her to the government hospital. They insisted that the girl be sent out immediately. It all started when the girl's mother M Lakshmi Devi married another HIV-positive patient K Khader Vali on Aug 20 at the Congress office here in the presence of agriculture minister N Raghuveera Reddy and MP A Venkatrami Reddy on the occasion of Rajiv Gandhi's birth anniversary. The girl was the daughter of Devi and M Kiran Kumar of Pulivendula in Kadapa district. Kiran migrated to Anantapur and worked as a room boy in a lodge. He was diagnosed as HIV-positive three years ago and died in March this year. Devi took shelter at a private NGO since then and the NGO head Usharani, who herself is HIV-positive, convinced Devi to enter into a wedlock with Vali. But with the HIV-positive couple's marriage receiving wide coverage in the local media, the parents swooped on the school and forcibly sent out the poor girl. While Usharani urged the district officials to take stringent action against the erring parents, district educational officer D Premanadam and II Town inspector A Srinivasulu went to the school to convince the parents. When contacted, school correspondent Madhav Rao said they have no objection to the girl studying since she has not tested positive for HIV. \"Why should the poor girl be harassed for no fault of hers,\" Usharani questioned."}

May sound strange, but a recent survey carried out by Population Services International (PSI), a NGO involved in action against HIV/AIDS, has categorised KPO workers as the next major sector that would contribute to higher prevalence of reported AIDS case in Karnataka. Quoting this PSI survey report, Gurudas M Bhat, additional Labour Commissioner at the inaugural function of Hassan regional level dissemination workshop of National policy on HIV/AIDS and World of Work here on Tuesday, said KPO workers seem to be more vulnerable to contract AIDS as much as lorry drivers, and labourers were until the recent past. The latter category compared to the former seems to be more aware of AIDS, he said. Observing that most of the workers in KPO sector, including IT and ITES, BPO and call centres were youths, and staying alone, he said it is natural that they might try to fulfil their biological needs without paying heed to the consequences. Sustained awareness campaign conducted for lorry drivers, and construction workers is bearing fruits and most of them overcoming inhibitions prefer to go in for protected sexual intercourse, he noted. The survey only confirms that stereotypes of categories of people who were hitherto considered to be high risk group no longer is true and that prevalence of AIDS is seen across categories of people be it KPO workers, bank employees and so on. \"AIDS has broken class barriers and every section of population could find themselves vulnerable unless they are careful with their sexual indulgence and take precautions,\" he said. The spread of AIDS is having a bearing on gross domestic product that is taking a hit of one per cent because of people infected by the disease, he said. The disease is difficult to detect and Supreme Court guidelines also makes it amply clear that no potential employer can screen a target employee for the disease as it invades of the personal liberties of the individuals concerned. This underscores the need for individual integrity, he noted. G S Gopal, manager, Systems Strengthening, PSI Connect later told TOI that a 'Most at Risk' survey carried out by PSI that covered all sectors of work force found that certain sectors were now in high risk category. These included sugarcane workers in Bagalkot and Belgaum districts, garment workers in Bangalore, mines workers in Bellary, and construction workers and fishermen in coastal Karnataka, especially Mangalore."}

In what will be one of the most ambitious interventions to combat HIV, the National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) has identified 68 main railway stations in districts across 11 states from where migrants usually board long distance trains. Studies on the relation between migration and HIV conducted recently by Naco in three popular migration corridors \u2014 Ganjam-Surat, Darbhanga-Delhi and Azamgarh-Mumbai \u2014 threw up shocking findings. The highest burden of HIV was found to be among migrants, after the high risk groups like sex workers and men who have sex with men. The studies have shown that two to four times more number of informal workers have non-regular partners or visit sex workers with only 25% using condoms compared to 42% by others. Around 5% male migrants and 13% female migrants reported sexually transmitted infections, nearly double the national average. What's worse, the total number of migrants continue to increase in India. According to the 2001 census, 30.1% of the population in 2001 was considered to have migrated (314 million of the total 1,028 million people), which shows a considerable increase from 27.4% in 1991. Naco, which has now asked the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria to grant $50 million for the targeted intervention on migrants, says, \"In India, there is increasing evidence and growing recognition of the importance of migration in the spread of HIV infection. Naco has, therefore, revised its migrant strategy and decided to identify high outmigration locations at source, transit and destination, providing them information about HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections and safe migration.\""}

It will be voluntary for the two-crore-plus workforce in private establishments and factories to undergo HIV test, but the policy will ensure that no one faces stigma or is given the pink slip if tested positive. The policy may also pave the way for employees to receive financial support from their employers for treatment, which is expensive. Stating that the policy will be introduced in three months, Maharshtra labour secretary Kavita Gupta said, \"We are fine-tuning a policy that will ensure that there is no discrepancy to any of the person with HIV at his workplace. It will provide employment and social security to HIV-positive persons.\" Labour minister Hasan Mushrif said, \"Many of the unions requested the labour department to conduct HIV test for the labourers. The proposal is under consideration. The decision is yet to be taken on the issue.\" Incidentally, the first case of AIDS was reported in Mumbai in 1986. According to National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), 14 districts of Maharashtra figure in the all-India list of 49 districts with high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. There are nearly two crore labourers (excluding farm and domestic workers) in Maharashtra. According to the state labour department, it will be mandatory for all the factories and establishments to adopt the HIV-friendly workplace policy. However, it will be the labourer's discretion whether he/she wants to undergo an HIV test. Those workers who opt for the HIV check-up and test positive can avail the benefit of the policy. \"Those who do not turn up for the check-up will be deprived of the benefits,\" said a health official. Justifying department's move, Gupta said, \"The aim is not to get information on number of HIV-afflicted labourers. Its aim is to provide financial stability (employment) and social security to those who test positive.\" She said the introduction of the policy will help earlier detection of HIV. \"Earlier the detection, better the chances of healthy survival of the victim,\" said Gupta."}

And, Varanasi is supposed to be one of the main centres of HIV infected persons due to its migrant population. \"In Varanasi district alone, there are over 1,000 persons infected with HIV and the number of such people goes above 11,000 in eastern parts of UP,\" informed secretary, Banaras Network of Positive People Living with HIV/AIDS Society (commonly known as BNP+), Sunil Seth. The network is spread over 30 districts of the state with active members to motivate and help HIV persons to lead a purposeful life. However, according to WHO report, over 34 million people are living with HIV and AIDS across the world. India alone, with 2.3 million cases of HIV, has the third highest number of HIV affected persons in the world. According to the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), around 3,22,521 persons were taking treatment for AIDS by April 2010. And, to give a new lease of life to such persons, the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) is playing a remarkable role. \"So far, 11,321 HIV patients have been registered with the ART Centre, Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU,\" said Dr Jaya of the centre. \"Around 4,500 patients are living on therapy and get regular medicines,\" she added. The ART at BHU is one of the 10 centres of excellence in HIV care in the country and the only in Uttar Pradesh, where the facility of second line drugs is available. It monitors the activity of 11 ART centres in Bihar, UP and Madhya Pradesh. It is also a training and research centre. According to the doctor, those patients registered in ART centre of BHU, who have completed six month's therapy and are stable and have increasing CD4 count, can be referred to Link ART centres affiliated to BHU ART centre established in the neighbouring districts of Ballia, Ghazipur, Jaunpur, Mau, Sonebhadra, Bhadohi, Chandauli and Azamgarh. They are basically drug distribution centres. Beside the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) and Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT) centre, Shiv Prasad Gupta District Hospital Kabirchoura, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Regional Hospital Pandeypur and Central Jail Hospital Sivpur are other centres where free HIV investigation is available under NACO supervision. The crux of the whole exercise is to protect precious human life. The doctor says if by mistake one deviates and acquires this disease, he should not lose courage. He should get investigated and should take proper medicine and advice from the health personnel. An early diagnosis of HIV status helps in preventing and significantly delaying morbid conditions associated with HIV/AIDS. If the HIV-infected person is irregular in time or quantity of the drugs, or he starts and stops the drugs abruptly, the treatment becomes ineffective. The HIV infected person can live a productive and healthy life if he takes care of his health, eating habits and lifestyle. Vital Facts What is HIV? Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus, which damages the body's immune system by destroying CD4+lymphocutes. This CD4 cells help us to fight against infections. Thus destruction of these cells by the virus leads to immune deficiency and susceptibility to different infections. How it spreads HIV infection spreads through unsafe sexual contact, transfusion of infected blood or blood products, sharing needles to inject drugs and from mother to child during childbirth and breast-feeding. However, HIV does not spread through mosquito bites, tear, saliva, urine, by embracing, casual kissing, hand shaking, working together, taking bath or swimming together with HIV infected person. In India, it is migrant population, truck drivers, community sex workers and IV drug abusers who are affected. They, in turn, spread the disease to their wives, children and clients. Clinical presentation Within a few weeks of being infected, some people get fever, headache, sore muscles and joints, stomach ache, swollen lymph glands or a skin rash for one or two weeks. Most people think it is flu. After the initial illness, patients can remain symptom free for many years (3-10 years), as the CD4 cell count decreases and the immunity decreases the patient first gets minor infection then the severity of infection increases. The last stage of HIV infection is when the CD4 decreases below 200 per micro litre is called AIDS when the patient may succumb to minor illness. How to get tested If any person wants to get himself tested for HIV, he should go to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) which provides free testing and counselling. The ICTC centres are present in every district hospital and medical colleges. If a person tests positive, he is referred to the nearest anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre. Treatment Once a person is infected with HIV virus, the virus can never be eliminated from the body. However, there are drugs available that can suppress the level of virus in the body. These drugs are available free of cost at all ART centres. Every HIV positive patient may not be started on treatment immediately. The treatment is started on the basis of CD4 count and stage of the disease. The treatment, if started, has to be continued lifelong. It is extremely important to adhere to the treatment so as to prevent failure of the drug regimen. Where to go for treatment The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) control programme in India through 35 HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Societies and 269 ART centres throughout the country. The ART centre at Sir Sunder Lal (SSL) hospital of BHU provides free HIV testing, treatment, counselling, nutritional advice and AVR drugs to the registered patients.

A two-day inter-faith summit organized by the foundation on HIV and AIDS was attended by religious leaders from across the country and abroad. One could sense the country\u2019s religious diversity in the ashram and also leaders\u2019 unity to fight against the common enemy. \"Even today, in rural India, religious leaders have a say. If it comes from them, people meticulously follow it. If they remain ignorant about it and keep condemning the HIV-positive, there will be more stigma,\" said Sri Sri Ravishankar. Leaders included that of Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Jainism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism and representatives from different states. They signed a declaration to remove stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV. \"We have committed ourselves to create awareness about it. We will spend 5-7 minutes to speak positively about HIV. We will publicly go into houses of HIV-positive people and associate with them. We ourselves will get tested to keep track of our HIV status,\" said Rev J P Heath, a leader living with HIV. \"In a country like this, how much ever doctors get involved, the stigma won\u2019t go without the involvement of people,\" he added. As many as 15 regional bodies have been formed to fight for the cause. Each will consist of leaders from different religions who will work together towards this end. \"Hindu swamis will work together with maulanas and Fathers. It will be a common platform for them to work,\" said Sri Sri. Laterm the groups will work on other pressing issues like alcoholism and female foeticide. MEET THIS LEADER J P Heath, founder of INERELA+, an international inter-faith network of religious leaders \u2014 both lay and ordained \u2014 living with HIV, spoke about his experiences. An Anglican priest, he found he was HIV-positive 11 years ago. \"I faced many a stigma myself. The first was self-stigma \u2014 the fear that you will be rejected by society. Many people do not survive this stage. In the second stage, I was wondering what will happen when the Bishop finds out. I thought I\u2019ll be kicked out of the House. Pressure and stress are not good for HIV. I told him, and he said you can continue working but do not tell anybody else,\" he said. Heath later raised awareness among his congregation about HIV and when he finally said he was positive, they asked him what was wrong about it. \"HIV does not rob you of your skills and potentials. Around 10,000 interface religious leaders are part of this network,\" he said. \"Religious leaders are humans. They are not divorced from the reality of life. There\u2019s an additional level of stigma because HIV is associated with immoral sex. They are vulnerable to HIV because they work amidst them. Cases like blood transfusion, tattoos and marriage can be the reasons,\" he said. INERELA+ was launched in 2008 and its prevention strategy has been adopted in a couple of countries."}

Be that as it may, 2.6 lakh people are still in dire need of ART. According to the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) latest report, \u201cTowards Universal Access\u201d, which tracks progress in achieving the 2010 target for HIV prevention, treatment and care; around 5.8 lakh HIV patients required ART in end-2009. Globally, the HIV epidemic continued to be a real public health challenge as around 33.4 million people are suffering from the lethal disease. In 2008 alone, 2.7 million people were newly infected with the virus. According to the report, only one-third of HIV patients have been put on ART, and coverage of prevention interventions is largely inadequate. This year, WHO\u2019s revised guidelines on ART for adults and adolescents, including would-be mothers, said ART would be initiated when CD4 cell counts reach or drop below 350 cells/mm3, irrespective of whether the patients have clinical symptoms. As per this count, though an estimated 11 -14 lakh HIV patients in India need ART, only 23% are receiving the treatment. The number of pregnant women, who require ART, is pegged at 43,000. But only 21% are covered. Another 30,000-76,000 HIV positive children, too, require ART. However, there has been a spurt in the number of HIV tests across the world. For instance, 100 countries had tested 67 million people last year. In 82 countries \u2014 for which comparable data was available for 2008 and 2009 \u2014 the median number of tests performed per 1,000 people had increased from 41 to 50, respectively. ART coverage, among young adults less than 15 years, has gone up from 22% in 2008 to 28% in 2009. Even the percentage of HIV positive pregnant women receiving ART to prevent mother-to-child transmission has increased from 45% in 2008 to 53% in 2009. In end-2009, 5.25 million people were receiving ART in low and middle-income countries, including India, which translates to an increase of over 1.2 million people from the previous year. The report maintains that HIV-related TB remains a cause for concern. In 2008, of the 9.4 million TB cases reported worldwide, an estimated 1.4 million were diagnosed among HIV patients. Though the rate of HIV test and counselling for TB patients is rising, the initiative is insufficient."}

Figures collated by a state government body which works closely with HIV positive persons throws up the alarming fact: as against the 119 prisoner from across the state who tested positive for HIV in 2009, the count this year has touched 362 as on date. The period between April to August this year alone saw the number touch the 239 mark. Also, HIV accounts for 30 per cent of the average 100-120 prison deaths each year in the state. More alarming is the fact that these figures are only approximate. For, there is no mandatory HIV screening of prisoners at the time of admission and thus officials admit that they are not aware of HIV status of many inmates in various state prisons. \u201cSome persons consider HIV tests to be taboo and do not give their consent to be screened. Even though they belong to the high risk group, their status remains unknown,\u201d said R V Chandravadan, project director of AP state AIDS control society (APSACS). With rampant instances of men having sex with men (MSM) once they are secluded from mainstream society and confined to their barracks, this figure is a fair indicator of the vulnerability of other prisoners, which is now manifest in the form of diseases. \u201cA large number of them are presently suffering from genital ulcer disease (GUD) which results from having unnatural forms of sex. Once diagnosed with such diseases, they become ten times more susceptible to acquiring AIDS at a later date,\u201d said a medical practitioner who recently visited and interacted with medical officers of two central prisons in the state. With APSACS having introduced its \u2018Raksha\u2019 project in state prisons in February last year as part of which prisoners are screened and those carrying the HIV infection sent for treatment, the mechanism is presently in place. But no decision has been taken yet by the prison authorities to keep a check on the HIV positive count once APSACS concludes its intervention programme next year. \u201cHabitual offenders who keep coming back to prison for petty crimes often indulge in unsafe sex outside and have multiple partners thus posing a threat to other inmates,\u2019\u2019 said a prison superintendent."}

A special emphasis during the discussion was on gender norms. The researchers emphasised the need to produce greater gender equality and to shift norms that place aggression, violence and sexual exploitation within the masculine domain and are aggravated under the influence of alcohol. Ongoing research in different countries suggests that women\u2019s risk of gender-based and sexual violence is also increased by their partner\u2019s alcohol consumption. Therefore, without addressing gender issues, efforts to reduce alcohol-related sexual-risk behaviour might only be partly successful. Speaking at the conference, Dr Ravi Verma, regional director, International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), said, \u201cGender is missing from many alcohol related as well as HIV related interventions. Interventions of any kind in the development sector must be conscientious of gender. Failure to do so may reinforce existing discrimination against women and girls.\u201d According to him, the majority of people who go for paid sex are problem drinkers and that they don\u2019t even use condoms. Some of the eminent researchers and subject experts who participated in the conference included Dr Kendall Bryant, director, Alcohol and HIV/AIDS Research, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, Dr Jean J. Schensul, founding director, Institute for Community Research and Dr KS Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India. The revelations of the studies presented by the key researchers prove that alcohol plays a direct and indirect role in promoting situations and decisions leading to unprotected sex with multiple partners in the general population and in vulnerable populations including mobile workers, and female sex workers, and those infected with HIV. The conference was organised by ICRW, in partnership with the Public Health Foundation of India, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the Institute for Community Research.

It is expected to benefit around 100 such women. Out of the 1,176 registered positives in the city, 200 are women of reproductive age. SACS director Dr Vanita Gupta says, \u201cBreastfeeding can transmit the virus to a child. We advise continuity of whatever milk a child is on. In case, a positive mother is unable to continue feeding the infant before it turns six months and makes it drink processed one, it develops infection.\u201d \u201cThe mothers need not bother about how to sustain the life of their young one as the free supply will continue until the baby turns six months.

The SACS has roped in a few NGOs to manage finances for the purpose. It is only after a doctor clinically decides the criteria of which patient can breastfeed, the milk tin is given, states Dr Archana Mohan of SACS. HIV can spread from a mother to her infant during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. When milk powder feed is followed by breastfeed, the lining of the baby\u2019s intestine is destroyed. This makes it susceptible to HIV, warns Dr Vanita. Most of the positives are unable to afford this nutrient. The virus disables them to work and earn livelihood.

To crosscheck the blood-test results, Patra got himself tested at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) at Pattamundai run by state AIDS Control Society. \"Its an unfortunate incident. The diagnostic test report compiled by ICTC conclusively stated that the complainant was never infected with HIV virus,\" said Biraj Kumar Sahu, the chief district medical officer."}

More disturbing fact is that the number of HIV positive pregnant women and newborn too has increased alarmingly. Chandrapur district is known for its tribal domination and Naxal influence. However, the town is gradually gaining new a identity of having most HIV victims. Figures obtained for Civil Hospital suggested that out of 32,651 people tested for HIV, as many as 1,123 (3.43%) were detected positive to the deadly diseases during 2009-10. The figure continued to rise in the current year. HIV tests on 19,089 patients in the next five months (up to end of August 2010) found 560 (2.93%) new patients in the district. Civil surgeon Dr Ramesh Bandebuche said that \"Even as our HIV/AIDS related awareness campaigns are on the number of HIV positive patients increased alarming in the recent past. Rise in HIV positive commercial sex workers is one of the main reasons for increase in the number of patients,\" said. He urged the people to have patience or take precautionary measures while visiting commercial sex workers. The health administration is also carrying out drives in red light areas to guide sex workers about necessity of using protective devises, he said. The rise in number of HIV positive pregnant women has disturbed the health authorities. HIV tests carried out on 23,033 ANC cases (pregnant women) showed 79 positive patients (0.34%) in 2009-10. In all, 81 newborns were HIV positive during the same period. Out of total of 47 babies (18-months-old) tested for HIV during last year, 10 of them were found positive to HIV. Similarly, a total of 15,350 pregnant women were tested for HIV between April and August and 28 (0.18%) of them were found positive. 21 newborn were positive to the disease. Out of 38 babies (18-month-old) tested for HIV, 5 were found positive during the same period. Figures suggest that HIV infection is also on the rise among pregnant women in the district. In majority of cases, infection comes from husband to wife, claimed health officials. Presently, a total of 1,613 HIV positive patients are taking treatment at ART centre in Civil Hospital here."}

With timely intervention and little help from doctors, they can deliver healthy babies, without passing on the virus. Doctors at AIIMS claim that they have successfully helped HIV positive women to deliver 84 children since June 2004, the highest number in all ygovernment hospitals across the country. Of these, 83 children are healthy and free from HIV infection. One baby died due to early infection. Head of the gynaecology department Dr Suneeta Mittal said 61% of these children were delivered through caesarean procedure as it reduces the chances of infection transmission by one-third. The rest were born through normal delivery. \"We screened more than 10,000 pregnant women admitted at AIIMS under `Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission' programme. Of these, 128 women tested positive for the disease. Fifteen percent opted for termination of the pregnancy while others were operated on and given the required drugs,'' Mittal said. Lalit Kumar, a counsellor at AIIMS, said that 75% of the HIV positive mothers treated by the departments were from the cities, including Delhi. \"There were some cases in which the women were found positive for HIV and the male counterpart tested negative. This led to tension in the family and their relationship was on the verge of breaking. But after the birth of the child, the family was happy,'' said Kumar. The treatment included doses of Nevarapin to the mother during delivery, followed by a single dose to the infant within 72 hours of birth. Except for one child who died within hours of birth as he was infected before the mother reached us, all children are safe and have tested negative for HIV, said Dr Mittal. Out of 84 children born, 47 have completed their periodical tests of 18 months and have tested negative for the infection. \"These children can live a healthy life now. We hope good results for other children too,'' said Dr Mittal. She said that breast feeding can also lead to transmission of HIV infection, so most of the mothers have been advised against it. According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), every year, more than 7 lakh children become HIV-positive via transmission from their parents across the world. Some 15-20% are infected during pregnancy, 50% during delivery and 33% through breastfeeding. \"Screening of pregnant women for HIV should be mandatory in all hospitals. This can save"}

At present, India, which has 2.4 million HIV patients, ranks third after South Africa and Nigeria. However, the country's HIV prevalence is still low at .31% \u2014 from .36% in 2006. Be that as it may, though seven lakh HIV+ Indians require the life-saving anti-retroviral (ART) drugs, only three lakh have access to the medicine. As far as mother-to-child transmission of HIV is concerned, India recorded 18,000 pediatric HIV births off 65,000 HIV+ mothers. India records 27 million pregnancies a year. These are the latest data from the 2010 AIDS epidemic report \u2014 the most comprehensive report on a single disease that was released by UNAIDS on Tuesday. For the first time, experts say the HIV epidemic is on the wane. At least, 56 countries have either stabilised or achieved significant fall in rates of new HIV infections. \"For the first time, we can see the world beginning to truly reverse the AIDS epidemic. Globally, it had peaked in 1999-2000. In Asia, it had peaked in 2003-04. The biggest problem in India is that too many people don't know that they are infected with HIV. Every HIV case is preventable and to have 1.2 lakh new infections in India show that we are not doing enough,\" said Dr Charles Gilks, who heads UNAIDS in India. He added, \"It is vital that India focuses on prevention as cost of treatment will continue to increase.\" Not only has new HIV infection rate fallen by nearly 20% in the last 10 years to 2.6 million in 2009 (3.1 million people had got infected in 1999), but AIDS-related deaths have also come down by nearly 20% in the last five years.

In a landmark study, announced on Tuesday, scientists have found that Truvada -- a single daily pill containing two drugs that is being used by HIV patients -- actually reduces the risk of contracting the virus by at least 44%. In what is being hailed as the biggest success in finding a prevention tool against the deadly HIV, the iPrEx study -- published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) -- found that those, who popped the pill more than 90% of the time, were 73% less susceptible to contract HIV. The study, which involved nearly 2500 high-risk gay men, is significant because it gives credence to an HIV prevention approach called oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which involves the use of anti-retrovirals (ART) by those who are HIV-negative and at high risk of infection. The findings come only a few months after an African study by the Microbicide Trials Network (MTN) showed that a microbicidal gel can help protect women from contracting the virus. \"iPrEx has proved the concept of oral PrEP, and now its up to the field to build on this success and work towards realising the full potential of this promising approach in different at-risk populations, such as injection drug users and women. I am now convinced that there will be a day when we have several safe and effective methods for preventing HIV,\" said Sharon Hillier, professor and director of reproductive infectious disease research at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The iPrEx study involved 2,499 participants from Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, the US, South Africa and Thailand who were randomly assigned to one of two study groups: Truvada (a combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine) or Placebo. All participants received safe sex counselling and free condoms, and were tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during their monthly visit right through the programme. Of the 1,248 participants assigned to the Placebo group, 64 acquired HIV during the study as compared to 36 of the 1,251 in the Truvada group. \"The findings of this study have immense implications for the entire HIV prevention field, but most notably for global efforts focused on the population of men who have sex with men engaging in unprotected receptive anal intercourse,\" said MTN investigator Ian McGowan. What about the concerns that people who take PrEP could develop drug resistance if they become infected with HIV? The researchers said, if someone became infected with HIV while using an ARV-based prevention strategy, then the patient's virus would be exposed to whatever ARV drug or drugs are being administered. Consequently, resistance to that drug could emerge."}

For decades the city was infamous for being the HIV capital of India, but figures available with the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society show that for the third consecutive year the HIV incidence is falling. If 5,420 AIDS cases were registered in 2007, there were only 2,942 cases in 2008 and 1,308 cases in 2009. \"So far this year, we have registered 966 cases,\" said MDACS chief Dr S S Kudalkar, adding that the epidemic is clearly on the wane. The city has many reasons to cheer on the HIV/AIDS front. Many of the indicators that are used to assess the epidemic's spread in the general population show a downward trend. The virus is lower than ever before among pregnant women, dipping from 1.24% in 2005 to 0.53% in the first 10 months of 2010. Public health experts say this unsuspecting segment provides the best indicator of the disease's presence in the general population. People who queue up voluntarily to donate blood provide another indicator of HIV's presence in the society: seropositivity has fallen from 1.06% in 2002 to 0.46% in 2009. In the period up to October 2010, only 903 from 2,19,332 donors tested positive for HIV. \"This means only 0.41% were positive,\" said Kudalkar. But the statistic that the MDACS director is most pleased about is the dipping number of deaths among HIV-positive people whose disease progressed to full-blown AIDS. At the height of the AIDS epidemic, say in 2004, the death rate stood at 8.67% among the 3,205 AIDS patients identified that year. This year, the rate has fallen to 3.7%\u2014that is, 36 deaths among 966 patients. \"It is obvious that with better availability of ART (anti-retro viral therapy), patients are leading healthier and longer lives than before,\" said Kudalkar. The downward trend in Mumbai is not surprising as the recently released United Nations AIDS organization's figures show. Globally, HIV infection rates have fallen by nearly 20% in the last 10 years to 2.6 million in 2009 from 3.1 million in 1999. Also, AIDS-related deaths have come down by 20% in the same period across the world. UNAIDS showed that India has 2.4 million HIV patients at present. The only factor clouding the happy picture is the fact that though seven lakh HIV-positive Indians need ART, less than half have access to it. In Mumbai, ART access improved only because more centres started distributing the life-saving drugs in the last few years. In Mumbai, MDACS statistics show that 24,086 of 52,828 HIV-positive patients registered for care in the city received ART in the period between 2006 and 2010."}

India has lifted all travel restrictions against HIV-positive patients. In 2002, the Union health ministry had issued a notification, stating that reference to a mandatory test for HIV for India-bound foreign nationals should be removed from visa forms. However, some embassies and consulates failed to enforce it, and continued to display the requirement of HIV test certificate on their websites as well as on visa forms. On September 17, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) sent an email to all its embassies and consulates, clarifying that there are no travel or residency restrictions for People Living with HIV (PLHIV) coming to India. MEA has asked all offices to remove the requirement for HIV test from all visa forms available with Indian Embassies and Consulates. The action was prompted by a parliamentary question on April 15 by Dr E M Sudarsana Natchiappan, MP and a member of the Forum of Parliamentarians on HIV and AIDS (FPA). Welcoming the initiative, Oscar Fernandes, MP and president of FPA, said, \"I am pleased that India has clarified its position to lift HIV-related travel restrictions.\" J D Seelam, MP and general secretary FPA, said, \"We welcome the step taken by MEA as globally there are ambiguities about India's standing on travel regulations based on HIV status.\" Dr Natchiappan added, \"We commend the leadership displayed by the Indian government. FPA believes that these types of travel restrictions limit the rights of people living with HIV and fuel discrimination and stigma.\" Thousands of people across the world have been deported or denied entry into countries because they are HIV-positive. Stigmatising HIV-positive individuals is contrary to effective public health programming. Official data shows that 66 countries deny entry, stay or residence to HIV-positive individuals -- of these nations, 26 deport migrants who test positive, seven refuse permission to stay beyond a certain time bar and six deny entry even for very short-term stay. \"These restrictions are in blatant violation of human rights, they stimulate stigma and discrimination and actually hurt the response to the HIV epidemic,\" said Kevin Moody, International Coordinator and CEO, Global Network of People Living with HIV. Union health secretary K Sujatha Rao believes that irrational discriminatory laws should be lifted. \"In India, we don't have any laws against residence or visit by HIV patient,\" she pointed out. Dr Charles Gilks, UNAIDS country coordinator, said such regulations were issued by many countries in the 1980s when little was known about HIV, and there was more of confusion and fear about the virus. Globally, there is no evidence that such restrictions prevent HIV transmission or protect public health. MEA's move upholds India's commitment to human rights and dignity of all people including those living with HIV. A WHO statement pointed out that such entry restrictions actually pressurise people into concealing their HIV infection from immigration authorities. \"They simply do not carry their HIV medicines on international trips. This could lead to drug-resistant HIV strains that are transmissible to other people. Besides, drug resistance allows HIV to replicate in the body more freely, people with higher viral loads are also more infectious,\" said the statement. The US, China and Namibia recently lifted their decades-old travel laws against HIV-positive patients."}

It said when it is a matter of life or death, there can be no discrimination in treatment. In an affidavit before the SC, National AIDS Control Authority (NACO) said second line ART for HIV patients could not be extended to those who had received \"irrational treatment\" by private medical practitioners. It said such persons were either switched to second line treatment at an early stage or were put directly on second line drugs without undergoing the preliminary treatment, thus making them hard cases. NACO's attempt to broadbase its second line treatment by excluding those who had little hope of surviving for long was, prima facie, unpalatable to a Bench of Chief Justice S H Kapadia and Justices K S Radhakrishnan and Swatanter Kumar, which was hearing a PIL filed by NGO Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust. \"We cannot go by this discrimination. Right to life is a constitutional right,\" it said. Solicitor general Gopal Subramaniam explained that world over, it was a common practice that there had to be a rationale for HIV patients for their upgradation from first line to second line treatment. He supplemented NACO's affidavit, which said, \"Irrational treatment prescribed by private medical practitioners where persons are switched to second line treatment without any evidence of treatment failure to first line ART leads to early drug resistance and consequent risk of transmission of resistant virus.\" NACO said about 70 hospitals had informed it that there were 24,212 persons on ART, of which 1,074 were put on second line treatment due to toxicity of first line drugs and another 2,173 because of treatment failure. With the PIL claiming that over 15,000 patients were currently receiving second line treatment from private clinics/practitioners, the Bench said, \"How can a person be punished if he is incorrectly treated upon by a private practitioner. Under Article 21, whether this argument can stand has to be seen. People are going to die and this cannot happen.\" The anguish of the court forced the government to seek 10 days time to do a rethink. The Centre agreed to call for details from all private hospitals and clinics and file a fresh affidavit."}

But, on the eve of the World AIDS Day, many children living with HIV/AIDS and their parents assembled in the city on Sunday and shared their life experiences and problems, like the discrimination and humiliation they faced in the society. Though there is a programme and facilities to control HIV/AIDS, most of them felt themselves excluded from the society. It was an initiative of the Uttar Pradesh Welfare for People Living with HIV/AIDS (UPNP+) with the support of UNICEF and Media Nest to give a voice to such persons and create awareness among people. Around 15 children from different districts including Varanasi, Chandauli, Jaunpur, Mirzapur and Bhadohi attended the programme. \"In Varanasi, there are 60 children of 5-14 age group who are infected with HIV,\" president of Banaras Network of Positive People Living with HIV/AIDS Society (BNP+) Manoj Kumar Singh informed TOI. According to him, the number of children living with HIV/AIDS (CLHA) in the eastern UP is over 500. The Varanasi district has over 1,000 persons infected with HIV, and the number of such people goes above 11,000 in eastern parts of UP. The UNICEF report estimates that 70,000 children below the age of 15 are living with HIV in India and 21,000 children are infected every year through parent-to-child transmission. According to the 2009-10 annual report of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), demographically the second largest country in the world, India has also the third largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS. As per the provisional HIV estimate of 2008-09, there are an estimated 22.7 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS in India. The HIV prevalence rate in the country is 0.29 per cent (2008-09) and most infections occur through heterosexual route of transmission. However, there are now 33.4 million people living with HIV, according to 2008 figures released by WHO. An estimated 2.7 million were newly infected with the virus and 2 million died of AIDS the same year. To take up the issue World AIDS Day is observed on December 1 to draw together people from around the world to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS. In Varanasi, the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) is playing a remarkable role. According to the records, so far over 11,000 HIV patients have been registered with the ART Centre, Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU. Around 4,500 patients are living on therapy and get regular medicines. The ART at BHU is one of the 10 centres of excellence in HIV care in the country, where the facility of second line drugs is available. It mentors the activity of 11 ART centres in Bihar, UP and Madhya Pradesh. According Kulsum Talha of Media Nest, the children living with HIV should be heard and given due importance to fill them with a sense of respect.

At daybreak, people begin to crowd around in the bustling marketplace to buy idlis and dosas from a woman who is HIV positive. Vijayarani's customers are aware of her condition, but have no problem patronising her. Vijayarani and her co-worker Sumathy, 40, who is also HIV positive, run the shop together, earning up to Rs 500 per day. On the eve of World AIDS day, the duo serve as yet another reminder of the manner in which the stigma attached to the disease can be overcome even in a socially backward town like Usilampatti. It was only three years ago that Vijayarani's world fell apart. She and her six-year-old son were diagnosed as HIV-positive. But when her husband, Elango, tested negative, he began taunting his wife and finally told her that he was leaving her for good. Vijayarani had contracted the disease from her first husband, who had died a few years earlier. \"Initially, I was devastated. I didn't know what to do. Then, I heard about the Vaigai network of people living with HIV/AIDS,\" she said. These women do not hide the fact that they are carriers of the deadly virus, but say that the society around them has come to accept them. \"People have come to realise that mere physical contact with a HIV-positive person does not spread the disease,\" she pointed out. Frail and thin, Vijayarani started out on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) soon after the diagnosis, and alongside struggled to achieve financial independence. \"I look as healthy as any woman in our village and we have a successful business. Isn't that proof enough?\" she said in between ladling sambar for her customers. Vijayarani admitted her son in school after informing the authorities of his condition. Now the nine-year-old is a student in the fifth standard who comes within the top ten ranks in the class. T Rajapandian, a local, who frequents the shop, vouches for Vijayarani. \"There is nothing to beat her two-rupee idlis and dosas and the tasty accompaniments. I also take parcels home for my children at nights,\" he said. P Annathai, who had been instrumental in spreading awareness about the shop, said, \"I told my family and friends that we should help them and not shun them.\" Dr E S Thangapandian, programme manager of the government-run district AIDS Prevention and Control Unit said, \"Theirs is an example for many to follow\"."}

Speaking to TOI, officials at Naco confirmed that there are two and three intervention sites for transgenders in Mumbai and Chennai, respectively. Dr Charles Gilks, UNAIDS India head, had recently said, \u201cTransgenders are the smallest group having the largest risk of HIV.\u201d The 2010 UNAIDS report on the global AIDS epidemic found that among the high risk group that got HIV infection in India last year \u2014 9.2% were intravenous drug users, MSMs (7.3%) and female sex workers (4.9%). In comparison, a study conducted 250 transgenders in the Mumbai site found HIV prevalence to be as high as 16% among them, NACO officials said.

Some have even been involved in commercial sex activities.

Hands Off Our Medicine!\u2019\u2019 is a chant being heard in the streets from Bangkok to Brussels and New Delhi to Nairobi as thousands mobilize to help protect access to affordable medicines. The two biggest challenges in treating millions of HIV/AIDS patients in developing countries are shrinking funds from international donors for AIDS treatment and rising drug prices because of policies being pushed by rich countries to protect their own pharmaceutical industries, stated MSF (Medecins Sans Frontiers) an international medical and humanitarian aid organization, in a press statement issued on Tuesday. In October 2010, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) had requested donors to meet the goal of $20 billion over three years (2011 2013) to provide funds to scale up programs. But only about $11.7 billion were contributed, way below the bare minimum of $13 billion needed just to keep existing programs running. Till date, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium and the UK have not contributed, pointed out MSF, adding that Belgium and the UK were expected to pledge soon. MSF has urged people to be part of the campaign against the free trade agreements that the European Union is pushing on countries like India which could damage the flow of affordable medicines to those in greatest need. \u2018\u2018Whether treating AIDS or tuberculosis, malaria or other infectious diseases, we cannot do our job without these affordable treatments.

Yerawada Central Jail in Pune has 120 HIV infected inmates, the highest in the state. \"A total 21,404 prisoners in Maharashtra's prisons were screened in the last two years. Of them, 4,472 inmates were from Yerawada Central Jail. Among them, 120 were detected with HIV infection which is the highest in the state,\" said Dilip Deshmukh, additional project director of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) told TOI on Monday Of the 467 HIV infected prisoners, 87 have been put on antiretroviral treatment as their CD4 count is less than 250, said Deshmukh. CD4 cells are specialised cells that protect the body. HIV attacks these cells and uses them to spread the virus which weakens the immune system. People without HIV infection have about 700 to 1000 CD4 cells in a drop of blood. HIV infected people are considered to have normal CD4 counts if the number is above 500 CD4 cells in on blood drop. Health experts say that prisoners can be HIV infected if they participate in unprotected sex or share infected needles while using illicit drugs. They also maintained that the HIV infection rate among prisoners was lower than the general populace that came for testing to integrated counselling and treatment centres at hospitals. \"The prevalence rate comes to 2.18 per cent of the total number of prisoners which is below the 4.7 per cent incidence rate in the general population coming to ICTCs for testing,\" said Deshmukh. \"The presence of HIV infected persons and those at high risk in prisons is a critical challenge. Unlike the general population, many prisoners may not be aware if they are infected with HIV. Often, vastly crowded living conditions lead to such behaviour among prisoners,\" said A L Kakrani, professor and head department of medicine D Y Patil Medical College. He is also an ex-member of the technical resource group of the Government of India on ART. \"The tedious prison environment, lack of occupation of mind and body and plain boredom lead to accumulated frustration and tension. This environment leads to the high-risk activities such as use of drugs and unprotected sex between men,\" Kakrani said. The history of five HIV infected inmates at Yerawada jail has revealed that they were MSM (men having sex with men), said Sudhakar Ingale, counsellor of the ICTC centre at the jail. \"We are spreading awareness about the risks associated with MSM among the prisoners,\" he said. A recent UNAIDS report says that the HIV epidemic in Asia was concentrated largely among people who inject drugs, sex workers (FSW) and their clients, and MSMs. About 90 per cent of those newly infected with HIV in India were believed to have acquired it during unprotected sex. The ICTC facilities The Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) facilities were started at Yerawada and Amravati jails by the MSACS as a pilot project on October 2, 2008 . The move came following a directive by the Bombay High Court. The ICTC facilities with full-time counsellors and technicians have been started at five more jails including Nashik, Taloja, Kolhapur, Aurangabad and Nagpur. The other jails in the state send the inmates for testing and counselling to government hospitals that have ICTC facilities. \"There are no plans to set up full-fledged ICTCs in all the prisons in the state. Earlier, a proposal was sent to the National AIDS Control Society of India (NACO), but they are ready to extend only training if the state government recruits workforce,\" said Deshmukh. An integrated counselling and testing centre is a place where a person is counselled and tested for HIV, on his own free will or as advised by a medical practitioner. The main functions of an ICTC include counselling and testing for HIV, creating awareness on modes of transmission, prevention of HIV/AIDS for promoting behavioural change and reducing vulnerability."}

The state government says that despite its best efforts, these patients numbering 4,478 at last count have remained untraced, many of them for years. Labelled as \"lost to follow-up\" (LFU) cases, these patients carry a mortality risk that is five times higher than patients who have been taking regular anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Side-effects of the medicines, lack of family support and social stigma are the main reasons why these patients have abandoned the treatment. \"These 4,478 AIDS patients from 48 ART centres across the state, who have a CD-4 count less than 250, have been untraceable since 2008,\" Santosh Wani, assistant director of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), told TOI on Tuesday. \"The list of LFU cases is generated every month,\" Wani said. \"Our outreach workers attached to the district community care centres make home visits to convince these patients and their family members about the need to resume treatment. However, in many cases, the patients change their place of residence, which makes it difficult for us to reach out to them.\" L Kakrani, professor and head of the department of medicine at D Y Patil medical college, says there is an urgent need to identify critical issues in patient registration and follow-up, and formulate strategies to improve patient retention. Kakrani, who was formerly a member of the technical resource group of the Indian government on ART, says the main reason for patients dropping out of the ART programme was the side-effects of the medicines. \"However, the side-effects, which include jaundice, anaemia and neuropathy, are seen only in the initial period of medication and are very minimal later. Patients are counselled about the side-effects before the start of the ART treament,\" he said. Other reasons for LFU cases are poor family support, social stigma, logistic problems and economic reasons, which include the cost of travelling to the ART centres. The movement to give free treatment to AIDS patients started back in 2005 with the opening of the first ART centre at J J Hospital in Mumbai. In the same year, eight more ART centres were started in government hospitals. Five centres were opened in 2006, 14 in 2007, two in 2008, 25 in 2009 and four in 2010. Besides this, 32 link centres were started in 2008, 63 in 2009 and nine in 2010. The idea behind starting link centres at rural hospitals was to ensure that patients did not have to spend much on travelling to avail of medication."}

According to mapping estimates of 2009, there are around 23,000 IDUs in the state with HIV prevalence of 26.1%. The national prevalence is 9%. \"There has been a four-fold rise in people suffering from HIV in Punjab because earlier we did not include the high-risk group,\" said Punjab AIDS Control Society additional director NM Sharma. With the state having nearly three times higher number of drug abusers using injections, the problem of HIV has only become more acute. \"The number is more than this and a survey is in progress to fathom the real problem,\" said Sharma. \"We don\u2019t know the number of HIV infected people. All we know is that we were detecting 4,000 people with HIV every year and the number has gone up to 5,000 per annum,\" he added.

Chawla said, \"We have started five Opioid Substitution Therapy Centres in Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Batala, Jalandhar and Ludhiana as part of the harm reduction services. The services will be expanded in time to come in other districts as per the programme requirement.\" What has become a cause for concern is the failure of health authorities to reach out to all those suffering from HIV and providing them adequate medical care. About 16,110 were registered in HIV Care till October 2010, but only half, about 8,890, were put on anti-retro viral therapy (ART) in the state. The numbers of those on medicine have only dwindled \u2014 with just 6,045 currently on ART in the state. So far, 1,325 people in the state have died of AIDS.

This, especially, since the government has failed to reach out to such orphaned children or provide any medical help despite the fact that they too are infected. Three small sisters and another brother-sister duo, not only have lost both their parents to AIDS, but the disease has been transmitted to them from their parents and has now, acquired full-blown form. The siblings' story is not an isolated one as there are hundreds such orphans in villages across Punjab. After losing father Raj Singh, Bhucho resident and a truck driver, in 2003, Lakwinder, then only 7-year-old, and his 4-year-old sister Jaspreet became orphans when they lost mother Karamjit Kaur, too, because of AIDS, two years later. When other family members (Raj Singh's elder brother) got to know that the kids too have contracted the disease, they drove them away. Then the kid's aunt, Kanti Devi, (deceased Karamjit's sister) came to their aid and brought both to her place in Mansa. Since then, both Lakhwinder and Jaspreet are living a miserable life with three children of Kanti at a dingy residence in ward number 16. She and her husband, Kuku Halwai, have no issues keeping the children. \"We are making both ends meet on our meagre resources,\" said Kanti, adding that the state government had miserably failed in providing any assistance to the AIDS-affected children. Kanti said in 2006, Holland-based NRI Gurmeet Singh Khaira had helped them and the family did not face much problem for about three years, but now again, they were facing financial hardship as both the children had to go to PGI for regular check up. Because of scarring on his face, Lakhwinder was thrown out of school but, Kanti, somehow, managed to get both enrolled in a small school in the neighbourhood. Likewise, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) rendered three sisters orphan on August 2, 2010, when their mother Rani Kaur died of AIDS. Six months back, their father Soma Singh, a truck driver, had died of the disease. Thirty-five-year-old truck driver Soma Singh used to remain away from the house for longer durations. \"During one of his trips, Soma fell ill seriously. It was then that we came to know that Soma was suffering from AIDS. After some days, he succumbed to the deadly virus,\" said Soma's brother Malkit Singh. After Soma's death, his wife Rani Kaur, too, was found suffering from AIDS apart from TB. Shuffling between anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre, Rani too bade goodbye to life leaving behind schoolgoing daughters Jasbir Kaur (13), Amrit (12) and 7-year-old Karamjit. Now, their single room hut in the Sansi mohalla (slum area) is their only adobe. \"Life has snatched everything from us, but still we hope to complete studies and stand on our feet,\" said Jasbir, with pain peeping through her eyes."}

In a year's time Samir lost his mother too. \"Can you see the smile of their faces? There could be no better gift for them on this day,\" said Namit Bajoria, managing trustee (BCF).

The theme of the camp was \u201cUniversal Access and Human Rights\u201d. Bihar State Aids Control Society (BSACS) and a voluntary organisation, Centre Direct, observed the day by distributing 30,000 condoms near the Patna Junction roundabout, Gandhi Maidan, Bansghat, Mandiri, Kurji More, Boring Road, R-Bloc crossing and Raja Bazaar. A team of the Centre Direct activists and BSACS officials did a survey of AIDS-affected people in these localities and conducted an awareness programme on preventive measures against the spread of AIDS."}

Children are the most vulnerable group, with such cases having increased by 46 per cent between 2001 and 2009, WHO said. \"The threat of HIV/AIDS to children highlights the need to strengthen health systems at the primary healthcare level and to integrate HIV-specific interventions within broader maternal and child health services,\" WHO regional director for Southeast Asia Samlee Plianbangchang said. Globally, an estimated 33.3 million people live with the virus, and 2.6 million were infected in 2009. About 2.3 million people live with AIDS in India. Regionally, women constitute 37 per cent of the 3.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS in Southeast Asia, and without any intervention, about a third of infants born to HIV-positive mothers could acquire the virus. \"The virus can be transmitted to an infant during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding. However, only one in three HIV-positive women can currently access antiretroviral treatment (ART) in the Southeast Asian region,\" he said. Widespread implementation of WHO's new guidelines on the use of ART drugs for treating pregnant women and preventing HIV infection in infants could substantially reduce pediatric HIV and improve maternal and child survival, he added.

However, the study underlines the fact that the children have very little awareness about the transmission of HIV through other routes like infected syringes, needles etc. This, researchers say, is an important gray area that needs to be addressed. \"The environment in which the children of sex workers live exposes them to drug pushers, drug peddlers and the sharing of needles for injecting drugs. These are potential risk factors for the transmission of HIV infection. The study assumes significance as the thrust has always been only on creating awareness on avoiding transmission through unprotected sex,\" said paediatrician Sharad Agarkhedkar, professor and head of the department of paediatrics at the D Y Patil Medical College under whose guidance the study was carried out. The study, undertaken by paediatrician Sampada Tambolkar and Aishani Shah, a third-year MBBS student was funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It was carried out between June and September last year and published in the Australian Medical Journal in June 2010. \"The objective of the study was to assess knowledge, attitude and practices of adolescent students of commercial sex workers in relation to HIV/AIDS and give recommendations about important issues identified during the study,\" said Tambolkar. Adolescent children in the age group of 10 to 15 years were selected for the study. They were given a pre-standardised questionnaire in which they had to answer the questions. Their anonymity was assured. The questionnaire was translated into Marathi by experts, for students. \"There were 36 girls and 14 boys who took part in the study. It was a descriptive study and there were no comparisons. The main point that emerged was the lack of knowledge about the spread of HIV and the means of acquiring the infection,\" said Shah. \"The social status of commercial sex workers widely affects their children. These children are exposed to the problems from a very young age and it is important to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS among them,\" said Tambolkar . \"The particular adolescent age group was chosen because they are largely exposed to unsafe sex and also to other potentially dangerous objects of transmitting infection like infected syringes, needles etc.\" Sharing other important findings, she said, \"The general awareness on the physical aspects of growing up among them was good. However, awareness about menstrual issues was poor though most of the participants in the study were females.\" \"The knowledge of ante-natal care (medical care of women during pregnancy) and its benefits were not adequately known. Awareness about teenage pregnancy and its hazards was good. They were relatively well informed about HIV causing decreased immunity and its spread by unsafe sex but they were ignorant about its spread by infected syringes, needles etc. This is important as these children may be exposed to such things due to the environment in which they live,\" said Shah. The researchers found that the attitude towards females was not very encouraging. \"A majority of the children thought that major decisions in the family need to be taken by the male members. Only 14% felt that it was incorrect to proceed with antenatal sex detection and most felt that trying cigarette once would not lead to addiction,\" said Tambolkar."}

Around 150 of Kolkata's 11,000 streetchildren are infected with AIDS but have never been treated or screened, showed a recent study conducted by the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases. Aged less than 14, the majority of them who have acquired the disease from their mothers could die before they turn 18 or even earlier. The alarming facts have been disclosed following the West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society's (WBSAPCS) response to an RTI application. The body has put the number of HIV+ children in the state at 684, including just 50 in Kolkata. Prantakatha, the NGO which filed the RTI application, has pointed out that more than 200 infected children have been traced in Kolkata alone. While the WBSAPCS claimed that their data has been compiled through various local networks and social organizations working at the grassroots with HIV+ people, Prantakatha alleged that the figure had been cooked up. \"They have no data on HIV-infected children. Even their website is silent on the number of paediatric HIV+ patients even though it declares the number of infected men, women and youth in the state. We had filed an RTI in August seeking information on the district-wise distribution of HIV positive children. After staying mum for months, they sent us a break-up of the number of patients across the districts on December 3. It said 684 was the total number. Kolkata, if they are to be believed, has just 50 HIV-infected children,\" said Bappaditya Mukherjee, secretary of Prantakatha. The WBSAPCS, however, claimed the data was authentic. \"We have collected the figures after a thorough interaction with local networks and scanning their information base. A large percentage of the HIV-infected children in Kolkata actually hail from the districts and they have been included in our list. But it's true that there's no government home for HIV children,\" said Swarnadipa Biswas, deputy director of WBSAPCS. Ananda Ghar, the only home for HIV+ children in the state has 42 inmates. Privately run by an NGO at Gobindopur in South 24-Parganas, it claimed that hundreds of infected youngsters from Kolkata and its outskirts were eager to join the home. \"At least, 150 children are waiting and we have regular contacts with them. Most are either orphans or social outcasts. This proves that the WBSAPCS data is fabricated. They have neither done a survey nor have any programme to care for these children,\" said Kallol Ghosh of OFFER, the NGO which runs the home. What could be even more dangerous is the threat they pose in terms of transmission, many pointed out. \"Few of the kids are aware of their status and have no access to Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART). Since a high percentage of them are drug-users, they could well be transmitting the disease,\" said Tarit Chakraborty, secretary of BNP Plus a network of HIV-positive people. Less than 25% of the children now receive ART, said an official at the ART centre in Calcutta Medical College Hospital. \"There has never been any study or survey. But information from private bodies working across the state, shows the total number of infected children could be more than 3000,\" said the official."}

The government had said it was willing to extend second-line treatment costing Rs 28,500 each to all patients except those irrationally treated by private hospitals. But a Bench comprising Chief Justice S H Kapadia and Justices K S Radhakrishnan and Swatanter Kumar wondered how the government could cite financial burden as a ground to deny treatment to a section that might have been irrationally treated by private hospitals. \"It is a question of right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution and the government cannot say finances are a constraint,\" the Bench said. Solicitor general Gopal Subramaniam realised the weight of the Bench's logic and abandoned the financial constraint argument to clarify that the Centre was more concerned about the capacity to treat rather than finances. There were only 10 viral-load testing centres, he said. However, the capacity constraint argument too sounded far fetched as the SG himself pointed out that till now, the government had received data identifying only 122 HIV patients who might have been treated irrationally by private hospitals and possibly face the risk of not getting the second-line treatment, exclusively offered by centres run by government. In an affidavit before the SC, National AIDS Control Authority (NACO) had said second-line ART for HIV patients could not be extended to those who had received \"irrational treatment\" by private medical practitioners. It said such persons were either switched to second-line treatment at an early stage or were put directly on second-line drugs without undergoing the preliminary treatment, thus making them hard cases. Faced with the SC's right to life argument, Subramaniam clarified that \"if any such case (irrational treatment) came to government centres, we will do our best\". The Bench asked the SG to get a clarification next week about the Centre's stand on working out the modalities for treatment of HIV patients."}

The mouth holds early tell-tale signs of diseases like leukemia, HIV-AIDS and viral infections, according to experts gathered in Chennai for the first international conference of the Indian Association of Oral and Maxilofacial Pathologists (IAOMP). The oral cavity is part of many important processes such as respiration, digestion and speech, and hence it is the first to be affected, doctors say. \"Take the example of HIV-AIDS. Instead of conducting blood tests for everyone in high risk groups, we can do an oral examination. If there is yeast infection in the mouth, the patient should be recommended for a blood test to confirm the presence of the virus,\" said IAOMP secretary Dr K Ranganathan. While swelling of gums and prolonged pain may be an indication of leukemia, several sexually transmitted diseases could cause lesions on the tongue. Oral inspection may not yield conclusive diagnosis of deadly diseases, but in a country like ours, where blood tests may not be possible on a large population, it serves as an efficient screening process. \"The mouth has largely been ignored while doing diagnostic tests for various diseases. Mouth can tell a lot about diseases of several organs,\" said Dr Carl Allen, professor of oral and maxillofacial pathology at the Ohio State University. \"Misdiagnosis of many infectious diseases could be avoided by just examining the oral cavity of the patient. Early signs of cancer are usually found in the mouth. Early diagnosis can prevent it from spreading. There are times when the patient has an oral condition for a long time but come to an oral pathologist very late by which time the cancer is beyond control,\" said Dr Allen, adding that oral manifestations precede symptoms in other parts of the body. The experts felt that most physicians and dentists were not trained to send patients with an oral condition to oral pathologists, resulting in wrong diagnosis. \"Most people visit a general physician when they have an oral condition when they should be visiting an oral pathologist. About 99% of patients I get are referred to me by other doctors rather than the patient coming on their own,\" said Dr Allen. The field of oral pathology in India, though more advanced now, still has a long way to go, felt IAOMP president Dr V Ramesh. \"We have only about 1,500 oral pathologists in the country, and a majority of the medical schools do not include oral pathology in their curriculum. This needs to change,\" he said."}

If true, that would represent a scientific advance, but not necessarily a treatment advance, said researchers familiar with the work. In the study, published last week online in the journal Blood, researchers at Charite-University Medicine here treated an HIV-infected man who also had acute myeloid leukemia \u2014 a cancer of the immune system \u2014 by wiping out his own immune system with high-dose chemotherapy and radiation and giving him a stem-cell transplant. Stem cells are immature cells that can mature into blood cells. At the time of the transplant, which occurred in February 2007, the patient, in his 40s stopped taking anti-HIV drugs. Thirteen months later, after a relapse of the leukemia, he underwent a second round of treatment followed by another stemcell transplant from the same donor, CNN reported. The donor\u2019s stem cells contained a rare, inherited gene mutation that made them naturally resistant to infection with HIV, according to the authors, led by Kristina Allers, who hypothesized that HIV would nevertheless rebound over time. But that has not happened, the report said. After three-and-a-half years off of anti-HIV drugs, the patient shows no sign of either leukemia or HIV replication and his immune system has been restored to normal health, the researchers reported, concluding, \u201cour results strongly suggest that cure of HIV has been achieved in this patient.\u201d But AIDS researchers predicted the report will have little impact on practice. \u201cThis probably is a cure, but it comes at a bit of a price,\u201d said Michael Saag, professor of medicine and director of the University of Alabama at Birmingham AIDS Centre. \u201cFor him to receive the donor cells, his body had to have all of his immune system wiped out\u201d and then receive a bone marrow transplant, Saag noted. The treatment associated with wiping out the immune system \u201cis very hazardous,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if somebody doesn\u2019t die from a transplant, there are complications that make it very unpleasant for people to live with,\u201d he said, citing graft-versus-host disease, where the infused donor cells attack the body.

The breakthrough was reported in the science journal Science Translational Medicine after it had been tested on 18 AIDS patients. But the scientists at Hanover university hospital or MHH in northern Germany said they have yet to find a way to put the substance, VIR-576, in a pill. All the test patients received it as an intravenous drip. Variants of the new therapy could also be devised to fight measles, hepatitis C and Ebola disease, they said. VIR-576 is a protein that smothers human immunodeficiency virus, stopping it docking with cells in the human body. \"It is a completely new therapy approach which we hope will reduce side effects,\" said Reinhold E Schmidt of MHH. Other existing medicines offered since the mid-1990s work by proofing cells of the body against the virus. \"Our peptide works on the virus, not on the cells, so some of the side-effects won't happen at all,\" he said. Current anti-AIDS medications ensure an almost normal life span for HIV-infected people but raise the risk of strokes and liver damage. VIR-576 caused some diarrhoea, but no other major side effects, the tests suggested. Schmidt cautioned that it could take years before VIR-576 was available from pharmacies as a medicine.

According to NGO Drone Foundation, which looks after these children, the kids are treated poorly at their school and the teacher in-charge of the government-run school warned of action if a medical certificate is not produced at the earliest. The children, who were orphaned, were first registered under the education program for underprivileged children run by DPS Maruti Kunj in March 2009.

Doctors said the substitute drug was more effective and problems, if any, would only be temporary. Anti-retrovirals, the drugs of choice for people with HIV/ AIDS, are distributed free of cost at several government hospitals across the state. Usually anti-retroviral therapy comprises the drugs zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine. Last month, doctors replaced nevirapine with a drug called efavirenz. Senior district officials said the drug was substituted following a letter from the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society. G Karunanidhi, president of HIV Positive Network, said members of his organisation complained of problems after being administered the new drug combination. \"Efavirenz is normally given to people with tuberculosis. In others, it could cause insomnia and tuberculosis resistance. Th government has distributed the drugs to clear stocks,\" said Karunanidhi. Tamil Nadu Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS secretary D Nandha Kumar said they were being needlessly given higher doses of anti-virals. Experts say efavirenz is more expensive and more effective, but need not be given to every patient. \"Efavirenz functions like nevrapine, but it works better,\" says Dr Sunithi Solomon, who heads YRG Care, an NGO working with HIV positive people. \"But if the patient is doing well with nevrapine, there is no reason to change the prescription. The patient may feel dizzy, but soon feel better,\" she said. Social workers are worried that HIV patients complaining of problems with the new drug might drop out of the therapy. \"Patients should have been warned about possible side-effects,\" said a social worker from an NGO in Tiruchi. Doctors said side effects would be temporary. \"Blood tests have found an improvement in the condition of people who were given efavirenz.

The Indian Patent Office recently rejected applications related to two key AIDS medicines\u2014lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir \u2014as they did not merit patents under the patent law. It is learnt that patent for the drug atazanavir bisulphate, filed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, was rejected because it 'lacked inventive ingenuity', while Abbott's patent application for lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) was turned down as it did not involve an 'inventive step'. The decision not only marks a major victory for public health and access to affordable treatment, but is particularly encouraging for government-run AIDS programme, which will soon provide second-in-line treatment to HIV patients. Already, the government-run programme covers approximately 3.8 lakh patients, mostly providing first-in-line AIDS drugs. After the recent Supreme Court directive, the government plans to scale it up and provide second-in-line treatment to a few thousands over the next couple of years. Both atazanavir (ATV) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) are recommended by the World Health Organization for second-line AIDS therapy. LPV/r is also sometimes used as first-line therapy for infants born with HIV. Abbot is reviewing the ruling, and said: \"New formulation of Kaletra have provided physicians and patients with real improvements in its use, dosing and convenience\". However, the companies have filed other patent applications in relation to these two drugs which are still pending with the regulatory body. Public health experts said that the ruling will be a great relief for the growing number of people who have become resistant to their first combination of AIDS medicines and need 'second-line' therapy, and is an encouragement to other producers to come in and lower the price further. \"These decisions show how India's patent law, which prevents routine improvements from being patented, works in favour of public health by onlygranting patents for drugs that are truly innovative,\" said Leena Menghaney of MSF's Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines. \"Before 2006, there was no generic production of lopinavir/ritonavir, and Abbott was able to charge exorbitant prices\u2014close to US$6,000 per person per year in some developing countries,\" she added. Today, generic companies like Hetero and Ranbaxy have brought prices down substantially to $440 per patient per year. Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance director general D G Shah termed the development as important for access to affordable treatment, for millions suffering from the disease. Generic companies including Cipla and Hetero are major suppliers of AIDS drugs to developing countries like South Africa. The rejection means that there will be uninterrupted supply available from India to AIDS programmes in developing countries, some of which have even issued compulsory licenses (Ecuador,Thailand) to overcome their local patent barriers to procure the drug from here."}

The group aims to educate the society about HIV and hopes that its efforts will go a long way in battling the stigma and discrimination that come attached with the dreaded virus. Sandeep, who is the president of an NGO, People living with HIV, said that he comes across several cases of discrimination against HIV-positive people. \"There have been cases where the families of HIV-positive persons refused to perform their last rites.

When contacted, Shetty said, \"There are various issues responsible for the poor functioning of the ICTC services at the PHCs. A shortage of trained manpower is one of them.

Deshmukh claimed that the regular transfer of trained staff required to carry out crucial jobs like testing and counselling at the PHCs was among the main reasons for work being hampered. \"There is also no sense of accountability among the staff who run the ICTC services at these PHCs.

The state administration had to hand over the body of John D'Souza, accused of sexually abusing minor boys, after his family met state chief secretary Sanjay Srivastava, who issued orders to this effect last night. John's family members claimed that his body was not being handed over to them as post-mortem was to be conducted on it since John, who died on January 15 while being treated at Goa Medical college and hospital, was a HIV patient. Prison authorities refused to hand over John's body to the relatives despite repetitive pleadings, they alleged. The kin, along with NGO Positive People, approached the state chief secretary and briefed him about the alleged harassment. They claimed that they had been asked to hop from one office to another under the pretext of formalities and clearances and were being harassed as John was an AIDS patient. Positive People, working for the people living with HIV, termed the attitude of state administration as 'shocking'. \"It is indeed shocking that the district authorities have not been able to release the body and have caused unnecessary pain and harassment to the grieving family who just wants to give a decent and dignified funeral to their dear one,\" the NGO's letter to the chief secretary said. D'Souza was kept in Sada sub-jail since his arrest in November 2009 for allegedly sexually abusing a 14-year-old boy in his car. The family members were asked to sign an affidavit stating that they have no suspicion on John's death before being handed over the body."}

The court refused to allow the plea of public prosecutor, Taufiq Ahmed, seeking capital punishment for the man on the grounds that he took law into his hands over a minor dispute. While awarding the life sentence, the court took into account several mitigating factors like the convict is HIV positive and committed the crime on the spur of the moment under the influence of alcohol. Murder is punishable with life imprisonment or death penalty. \"No doubt, all murders are most degrading and depraving but the case in hand certainly does not fall within the category of rarest of rare or least even in category of rare case,\" the court said. It also noted that the victim, Rajbir, was murdered because he tried to intervene in the ongoing quarrel between his friend, Ravi Kumar, and the convict. The fact that the convict was facing charges in two pending criminal cases also went against him. The convict, who was inebriated, had hit Rajbir on his neck and face with a broken beer bottle on December 19, 2008, in Ashok Vihar here, resulting in his death.

Today, Munna (name changed) is on the verge of death. This innocent boy contracted the deadly Aids disease from his parents. He doesn't know what it means and doesn't respond to any of your queries. Last week, he suddenly collapsed while having dinner. He was rushed to the medico but the doctors said he was alright. Next day, he suffered a paralytic attack and on subsequent day, lost his vision. Munna had already lost his father, a daily wager, to this deadly disease five years back. His poor mother Parvati, who is also HIV positive, tried hard to treat him from reputed doctors in the city. In the process, she exhausted her savings of Rs 30,000 she had accumulated over the years. Fortunately, her other two children haven't contracted this disease. Her life was shattered after her husband died, but she was given a helping hand by ACCEPT, an NGO that works for welfare of people living with HIV (PLHIV). She now works in the same organisation at a meager salary of about Rs 3,000 in which she manages her household expenditure and education of her three children. She also pays Rs 600 rent in her extremely small 10X5 sq ft room and travels by cycle. Despite all these problems, she is putting up a brave front and hasn't lost hope. \"I visited many doctors, but his disease could not be detected. He is HIV positive since birth. We know that he will not last beyond 15-20 years. But at this tender age, he became paralytic and lost his vision, which is rare,\" she says. Sameer Shinde, working with ACCEPT centre, is helping the family to save Munna. \"He's very enthusiastic and brilliant kid and used to interact with us whenever he used to come with his mother. He is very friendly and intelligent,\" he said. \"Even we were shocked over his rapidly deteriorating health,\" ACCEPT coordinator Josh Varghese Joy says, adding that they had sent the kid to their Bangalore head office where such types of cases are usually handled. ACCEPT workers are helping out Munna and they are glad that people are coming forward to help too. When Munna and his mother were travelling to Bangalore, they had tickets for the sleeper class but had to be upgraded to the AC car as the sleeper class was full. \"Even AC was full, but we requested the ticket checker to allot them at least one berth. Surprisingly, he didn't charge us even a single penny extra for the ticket seeing Munna's worsening condition and prayed for his life,\" Joy said."}

This is not an ordinary achievement for J J staffers as not many hospitals are willing to 0take up HIV-positive pregnancy cases. \u201cMost of the HIV-positive pregnant women who come to us are either denied admission by hospitals or are referred to us,\u201d said Dr Rekha Daver, head of obstetrics and gynaecology department at J J. The incidence of the babies born with HIV-positivity also has been low, claims the hospital. \u201cWe cannot say exactly how many babies were born HIV positive, as many mothers do not return to get their babies tested. But our estimation says that of all the HIV-positive deliveries, 5-10% of babies get the mother-to-child transfusion,\u201d said Dr Daver, who is also the head of positive parent to child transfusion (PPTCT).

Maharashtra District AIDS Control Society (MDACS), however, agrees that the load of conducting deliveries of HIV-positive women has largely fallen on public hospitals. \u201cPublic hospitals get majority of HIV-positive pregnant women as private hospitals do not want to do these deliveries. While the number of HIV-positive women directly coming to the public hospitals is high, those referred from private hospitals is equally high,\u201d said Dr S S Kudalkar, project director of MDACS.

In a meeting with insurance companies and the Insurance Regulatory Development Agency on February 3, the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) will press them to make insurance \"inclusive and universal for PLHIV\". Currently, HIV is excluded from all insurance policies available in the country \"violating the national mandate of providing stigma free care and support services\". Union health ministry officials said that HIV/AIDS which was earlier regarded as a \"incurable disease\" has now become a \"manageable health problem\" and, therefore, should be included in medical insurance policies. \"Right now, there are individual health schemes in some states which cover certain healthcare related costs of PLHIV. Many health insurance policies exclude services to PLHIV and there is need for a package designed specially for such people. We will discuss global best practices to see how a viable insurance policy can be created for them,\" joint secretary Aradhana Johri told TOI. Another ministry official said, \"Those living with HIV are living longer and have less morbidity cases, thanks to the increase in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) coverage. With timely initiation of ART, PLHIV may live a normal life up to 20 more years. Companies need to realize that covering HIV patients with a medical policy is no more a loss making proposition.\" India with a HIV prevalence rate of 0.31% is home to the third largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world -- 23.9 lakh. Some countries with higher prevalence rates of HIV have already taken measures to mainstream HIV through commercial health insurance cover. These include South Africa (17.8), Namibia (13.1), Uganda (6.5), Guyana (1.2) and United States (0.6). K K Abraham, chief of Indian Network of People Living with HIV, said, \"Insurance is life saving for us.\" At present, only Star Health and Allied Insurance has an insurance policy for PLHIVs in four states -- Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. More than 7,000 PLHIVs have subscribed to this insurance which provides a health cover of Rs 30,000 with a yearly premium Rs 1,511. NACO says that with about 89% of all HIV/AIDS infections being in the 15-49 age group, it effects in the most productive years. Currently, the financial burden of treatment and care is shared by NACO and PLHIVs. While NACO pays for ART, PLHIVs face economic burden of travel, nutrition and loss of wages. Recently, India launched the national health insurance scheme, Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), for BPL. It is to be rolled out in 366 districts in 29 states. As on December 23, 2010, a total of 22,354,462 smart cards have been issued across 260 districts in 27 states. NACO says, \"HIV has been taken out from the exclusion list making it possible for poor PLHIVs to be covered under health insurance, which can make them entitled to one time hospitalization for nearly 700 in-patient procedures with costs up to Rs 30,000 by paying a minimal registration fee of Rs 30 per annum.\""}

An international team, which carried out a research funded by the Australian and Canadian governments, claims that they probably found a \"genetic\" method which would help the body cure itself of HIV. In fact, in a series of tantalising experiments on rats, the scientists were able to harness the immune system to such an extent that it defeated the virus and completely removed it from the body , the Daily Mail reported . The breakthrough centres on a gene called 'SOCS-3'. When faced with an overwhelming infection such as the HIV, the gene becomes highly active and slams the brakes on the immune response, allowing the virus to persist . When the scientists boosted levels of a hormone called IL-7, the gene \"switched off \" and mice were able to gradually remove HIV from their bodies. While there have been advances in treating the condition ,the virus' remarkable ability to outwit the immune system means that the recipe for a cure has so far eluded even the world's best researchers . The experiments on mice , the team believes , raise the possibility of a cure , not only for HIV but also for other long-term infections , including hepatitis B and C and tuberculosis . A lot of the work into finding a cure for these illnesses has focussed on trying to use the immune system to gradually eliminate the virus or bacterium . But the latest research suggests a short , sharp shock is far more effective . The scientists said the research had provided \"excellent ideas\" for new therapies that could target and boost host immune cells called T cells to fight disease , rather than targeting the disease itself. \"The findings could help to develop drugs that target some of these host molecules , such as SOCS-3 , and turn them off for very short , defined periods of time to reinvigorate the T cells, allowing them to regroup tofightinfection ,\" Pellegrini said ."}

A division bench of Chief Justice Mohit Shah and Justice S J Vajifdar was irked to hear that the delay in granting the NOC has left the boy in the lurch and that he will now have to wait till another couple decides to adopt him. The boy was given for adoption by the Pune-based Preet Mandir, which faced suspension following complaints of financial malpractice and human trafficking last year. \"The boy was born to a HIV positive mother and had symptoms of the disease. A Spanish couple still agreed to adopt him in February 2010 and started the formalities, but following CARA's decision to suspend Preet Mandir's licence, the formalities were not completed. Even the boy's health is deteriorating,\" Merchant told the court. Merchant is representing six more foreign couples who agreed to adopt eight children from Preet Mandir. Three couples are from Spain and Italy, one is from Canada. Hearing Merchant's submissions, the judges remarked: \"You (government) are not considering the condition of these children. Unnecessary delay is not only creating hurdles in the adoption procedure, but also seriously affecting welfare of the children who have been selected for adoption.\" Merchant told the court that there are 86 children with Preet Mandir waiting for adoption. Of the eight selected for adoption, one is suffering from Hepatitis B and another has a severe orthopaedic problem. \"But the couples still want to adopt them. They can get better treatment once they are adopted,\" Merchant said. Preet Mandir came under the scrutiny of various authorities following a sting operation carried out by a news channel showing that the adoption house sells babies for more money to foreign parents. Sakhee-a Non governmental Organisation (NGO) had filed an application in 2008 seeking an inquiry against Preet Mandir. Preet Mandir's counsel, senior advocate Prasad Dhakepalkar said that the CBI had in 2010 lodged an FIR against just one of the trustees. \"The government should not shut down the adoption facilities because of this FIR.

The child was kept hungry throughout the day, alleged his parents. Neurosurgeons, who carried out the operation, alleged that the delay was due to the anaesthetist, who came in late.

There are allegations that the anaesthetist was hesitant to attend to a HIV positive patient. Refuting the allegations, the anaesthetist Narayan Acharya said, \"The delay in operation has nothing to do with the patient being HIV positive. The child was very sick and special intervention as venesection (where a vein is surgically opened to obtain intravenous access) was required to administer anaesthesia to the patient.

She has transformed from a shy homemaker to a 29-year-old working woman. She earns Rs 3,000 a month and gets free accommodation in the state capital. But, all was not well for her 10 years ago. This Class IX dropout, who hailed from Narayanpur village in Kendrapada district, was in her teens when she fell in love with Abhay Behera, a youth of her age. Abhay had just started working at a cloth factory in Surat. \"I eloped with Abhay against my family's wishes. It was for me a perfect married life. Well that is what I thought for the next few years,\" Sumitra recalls with a smile. \"Within two years, we were blessed with a baby boy. Both our families had also accepted us by then,\" she says. But she was oblivious of the fact that days after landing in Surat, she had contracted HIV from her husband in 2001. \"I was tested HIV+ during a routine pre-natal check-up during my first pregnancy in 2003. I must have contracted it much earlier, because my husband had been tested positive years ago. I got to know this just five years ago in 2006 during my second pregnancy,\" she narrated. \"Earlier, my husband had hidden his disease from me. He probably thought that since our son had tested negative, there was nothing to worry about. He had debarred me from breastfeeding him giving me some lame reasons, which I did not comprehend, but let go anyway,\" she said. When Sumitra was pregnant for the second time, her husband was suffering from high fever that required hospitalisation. They returned to Orissa to treat him. \"That is when he revealed to me our HIV+ status and said that he would not live long. He died two months later,\" Sumitra said. She then got worried and took another test in Kendrapada. There she tested positive. That was not all, her new-born child also tested positive a few months later. That is when she felt the world was crashing down on her. Even as she was trying to overcome the grief of her husband's death, villagers started avoiding her and almost ostracised her. \"Both the in-laws and my parents were reluctant to take me in. After much persuasion, my parents agreed to raise my elder son since he had tested negative,\" she recalls. \"I was thinking of ending my life along with my second child. But then, some HIV/AIDS volunteers counselled me,\" she said tearfully. With her month-old child in tow, Sumitra moved to Angul and started life afresh. She took a job of a maid for an NGO and in turn found shelter. Later, she moved to Bhubaneswar and joined a community centre for AIDS patients as an attendant. \"Although her profile is that of a house-keeper, she also helped counsel inmates using her own life story as a case in point,\" says Dr Dilip Samal, convenor of Medics, the NGO that runs the 10-bed indoor facility for AIDS patients. She gets Rs 3,000 a month and accommodation in return for her service. Interestingly, Sumitra has not fallen ill all these years. Nor has she undergone an anti-retroviral therapy. \"Her CD4 count (blood cell that gets affected in case of HIV) is good. She doesn't require medication,\" said Dr Samal. Besides, CD4 count of her younger son, Sivam Prakash, is improving. Sumitra gets to see her elder son Om Prakash once every three months when she travels to Kendrapada to collect her pension that she gets as a widow of an AIDS patient."}

While counselling her, the doctor learnt that she not only has multiple partners, but hunts for them with a vengeance to spread the virus she contracted through her husband. \"She was brought to us by her sister, who herself is HIV positive,\" said Gilada. \"We found out that she had learnt of her husband's HIV-positive status in 2005, and that he had transmitted the disease to her as well. Although she divorced him, she couldn't come to terms with the fact that he had knowingly passed on the virus to her,\" he said. Gilada said that during the counselling sessions, the woman, who works as a maid, claimed she has had more than 300 sexual encounters with 100 men over the past three years. \"She admitted to frequent encounters with men ranging from her employers and their relatives, to the liftman and students - all of whom have had unprotected sex with her,\" said Gilada. When asked about the case, Dr S S Kudalkar, president at the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS), said the organization would investigate the matter. \"We will talk to the clinic and investigate the case. If it is true, then we will counsel the woman,\" he said. \"HIV is not just a disease of the virus, it is also a disease of human behaviour.

The Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute (THSTI), an autonomous institute under the department of biotechnology (DBT), and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), have signed an agreement to jointly establish, operate and fund this HIV vaccine design programme. The programme will primarily focus on one of the greatest scientific challenges of AIDS vaccine design and development - the search of antibodies capable of neutralizing a broad spectrum of circulating HIV strains. Bringing hope to the idea of developing an effective vaccine against the deadly virus, scientists have been working on powerful new antibodies that neutralise all major forms of the virus. An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria. Scientists say these antibodies would ultimately reveal the Achilles heel of the virus. Studies have found that antibodies target a stable portion of the virus that does not frequently mutate - a defence mechanism that has till now helped the virus escape earlier developed experimental vaccines. Experts in this Indian lab will now look at new antibodies and how they bind to the virus. This will tell scientists which part of the virus to target with vaccines. The idea is to create artificially synthesized mimics of their targets on HIV, to be used in vaccines to elicit similar actions and teach the immune system how to thwart HIV infection. \"With 7,100 people contracting HIV every day, effective tools to prevent infection are indispensable to the fight against HIV and AIDS. A broadly effective AIDS vaccine would be a powerful asset to efforts to arrest the spread of HIV,\" said M K Bhan, secretary of DBT. This collaborative programme will participate in a coordinated, global effort to create replicas of virus targets in the laboratory for use as immunogens, which are the active ingredients of vaccines. The programme will have the task of developing, testing and then implementing strategies to rapidly screen large numbers of immunogens against HIV-1 (dominant strain) and to prioritize them for further evaluation in preclinical studies. \"We are very excited about the launch of this collaboration,\" said Seth Berkley, CEO of IAVI. Other institutions participating in this partnership include the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology in New Delhi and the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Indians, too, are being screened for such effective HIV slaying antibodies. The country has its share of \"late progressors\" or \"elite controllers\" - people infected with HIV who stay healthy for years without requiring life-saving anti-retroviral treatment (ART). About one in 300 people with HIV is an elite controller. Meanwhile, another fascinating community - mainly comprising women - has also got scientists in India excited. Called \"exposed sero negative\" these are women who have, for years, had sex with HIV-positive, condom-refusing husbands, but never got infected. Many have also had babies who are not HIV-positive. Scientists are studying these elite controllers to see whether they carry special genes, which prevent the virus from multiplying in their bodies. The cure for AIDS may come from members of these two communities, scientists believe."}

Though government officials have been claiming that none of the provisions in the FTA would affect India\u2019s ability to produce cheap and effective medicines, the fact that the government is not making the documents of the agreement public is raising suspicion about the actual nature of the contents. One of the most damaging provisions in the FTA is the grant of data exclusivity, something that the Indian Patent Law does not allow at present as Parliament did not think this would work in the interest of the Indian public\u2019s need for affordable medicines. Data exclusivity would mean that clinical trial data filed by one company cannot be relied upon by any other company. Each company will have to produce its own clinical trial data, which would be a waste of resources as different companies subject people to repeat clinical and pre-clinical trials to prove the efficacy of the same drug.

Moreover, 32 per cent surveyed patients said there were no drinking water facilities and toilets at the centres. Presenting the findings at the Orissa MDG (millennium development goal) Forum recently, principal researcher of the study Andrew Dutta said over 50 per cent HIV positive people were not satisfied with the ART services in the state. Persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs) were not getting information on adherence and side-effects of ART from these centres. Dutta said the ART centres were found wanting in offering services like counselling on nutritional support, availability of nutritional supplements and clarity and check-up on side effects. One-third of the patients were unwilling to revisit the ART centres for lack of laboratory technician and proper ambience. It is also difficult on the part of patients to get the CD4 tests done at the centre for staff shortage. These forced them to come to the centres again and again.

Dr Chhina said that during the initial stages, a mild flu and swollen glands are common and these symptoms are often ignored till the situation worsens. She said that the disease is transmitted primarily through sex (anal, vaginal or oral) with an infected partner, by injections (sharing contaminated needles for drug abuse or accidental piercing of a contaminated needle), from an infected mother to her child through pregnancy or breast-feeding, infected semen and vaginal fluids and infected blood transfusion. It was also pointed out that everyday, the health care workers are exposed to occupational hazards and are therefore more prone to AIDS.

To add to this, the ongoing mapping in rural parts will possibly take the figure to 2 lakh or more, say officials. Previous surveys had estimated the number of sex workers in the state at 1-1.2 lakh, clearly indicating that the number is on the rise. As per the survey, there are 22,000 female sex workers and 4,000 Men having Sex with Men (MSMs) in Greater Hyderabad. The survey, costing Rs 1.5 crore and funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, was primarily carried out to saturate the HIV/Aids prevalence among this group. So far, APSACS has been unable to initiate steps to control the prevalence of the disease as 50 per cent of the population was out of bounds for the agency. Now, armed with the data after the scientific mapping exercise, APSACS has scaled up the interventions for this untapped population. \"We have 38 new interventions now to ensure that the practice of safe sex is followed and the high risk groups go for routine medical check ups to check their HIV status in Hyderabad,\" said Kailash Aditya, joint director (targeted interventions), APSACS. As part of this, police is also being sensitised to nab traffickers and pimps instead of sex workers. Quoting the 2008-09 data, authorities said that 11 per cent of the sex workers were found to be HIV positive in the state. Besides, the HIV/Aids prevalence among MSMs was a significant 23 per cent. To contain the numbers from going up further, this updated data would come in handy to plan and scale up the interventions. AP has an estimated 5.4 lakh people living with HIV/Aids. The survey also revealed that several massage and beauty parlours were actually involved in sex trade. This apart, the organised business is now operating from residential apartments. It was also revealed that 65 per cent of the soliciting is now taking place through mobile phones. While more than 50 per cent of sex work is still street-based, around 40 per cent is home-based, with the remaining being brothel-based and lodge-based. The highest number of sex workers were found in the towns of Krishna, Kurnool, Guntur, West Godavari, Chittoor and Visakhapatnam districts."}

Chavan raised the issue at a meeting called by state legislative assembly speaker Dilip Walse-Patil to discuss issues relating to the setting up of the Maharashtra Legislators' AIDS forum. Under the aegis of the forum each legislator will contribute Rs 1 lakh to the fight against AIDS. Walse-Patil said while legislators were meeting to discuss the expenditure of Rs 15 lakh, no questions were being asked of the AIDS agencies on how they were spending Rs 100 crore annually. For 2010-11 the agencies have received grant to the tune of Rs 126 crore. \"The entire show is being run by bureaucrats but the government has no information whatsoever,'' he said. Chavan said the government had a right to know how the heads of the agencies were appointed. The three agencies include the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) which works in Mumbai only, Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) for the rest of Maharashtra and Avert, an agency that is funded by USAIDS. What has miffed the state government is the refusal of the agencies to be subjected to state scrutiny as they directly receive funds from the Centre and in the case of Avert from USAIDS. An audit of the three agencies done at the behest of Walse-Patil revealed that though a state apex committee was set up to monitor the AIDS programme, its last meeting was held in 2001. The audit also showed that Avert has no permission from the state government. \"No documents were available at the state government level on the establishment of Avert,'' reads the audit report. Smriti Acharya, project director, Avert, said the agency was set up through an agreement between the Indian government and USAID in 1999.. \"As per Avert's memorandum of association, the additional chief secretary (health), government of Maharashtra is the chairperson of the society,'' she said. The society, said Acharya, had submitted all relevant documents for scrutiny. \"We have also asked the National AIDS Control Organistation to provide any documents it may have on the issue. We are awaiting a reply,'' she said. The audit also revealed that when MSACS was set up in 1998 the state public health minister was not informed about the decision. The decision was taken at the secretary's level. Later the secretary did admit to it being an inadvertent error and assured that it would not be repeated. Health minister Suresh Shetty said unlike other states where there was a single agency to implement the AIDS programme, in Maharashtra there were multiple agencies. \"We may require two agencies, one exclusively for Mumbai. Also now that the forum has been set up, we want to ensure that the Rs 1 lakh contributed by each legislator is spent in her/his constituency and there is transparency,'' he said."}

It is because of this migrating population that the women and children too face the risk of turning HIV positive. Though Jaisalmer is a low-risk area for now, the increase in number of HIV positive and AIDS cases has become a major concern for the district. According to experts, thousands of labourers travel to big cities like Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata and others, mainly for work. \"These laboureres spend months in big cities and often are involved in unsafe sex and and carry back the virus with them,'' said Jugna Swami, who works with the high-risk groups in the district. She claimed the situation has deteriorated in the past four or five years. \"It's because of these migrants that women and children too are getting infected,\" Jugna claimed. She adds after the migrants, it is the sex-workers in the district who fall in the high-risk group. \"It is not uncommon for housewives in the slum areas of Jaisalmer to have multiple partners and a number of them are involved in prostitution as well,'' she said. Volunteers working on the AIDS programme in the district regularly visit the high-risk groups, couselling them and ensuring they agree to a full medical check-up every three months. A recent survey conducted by NACO estimated the number of sex-workers in Jaisalmer town alone to be about 1,500. This apart, a 2009 survey revealed that 1,140 camel owners in the district were involved in prostitution. Jugna's NGO distributes over 70,000 condoms to the high-risk groups every month. Jaisalmer town alone has 19 condom-distributing depos. Two dispensing boxes have been fitted in Sam specially for the tourists and the camel riders. \"Reports suggest that even foreign tourists are involved with the camel riders, specially when they opt for long camel safaris in the desert. Over the past two years, special efforts have been made to counsel the camel-riders. Though, in most cases, foreign tourists are known to play safe and take all precautions,'' admitted Jugna."}

This matter was highlighted in Parliament recently that HIV infected children continue to face discrimination even in their schools. The government has told Lok Sabha in reply to a question that 61 students were thrown out of schools in the country over the last 3 years and of these, four HIV positive students were from Gujarat. Apart from these four, there was also one incident of discrimination reported from Ahmedabad. However, complaints and timely action by the officials prevented the students from moving out of the schools. The government quoted National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) in saying that these 61 children infected by HIV were removed from the schools in various instances during 2008-2010. The discrimination cases were reported from Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Kerala, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The central government said that advocacy programs are conducted to sensitise principals and teachers to ensure that students with HIV/AIDS are treated with dignity and respect. National AIDS control Organization (NACO) and State AIDS Control Society along with their state and district level networks also conduct advocacy programmes with various stakeholders including school principals and teachers. Dr Pradeep Kumar, additional project director Gujarat State AIDS Control Society admitted that such incidents have taken place, but the state had ensured that these students were back to the schools. Pratik Raval, coordinator, Greater Involvement of People living with AIDS says that of the four incidents, one was in Mehsana, one in Rajkot and two in Bhuj. About the Ahmedabad incident he said that the incident was averted due to advocacy by the officials. He further said that since 2008, there have been no such incidents. The state education department has already issued a directive warning of stern action against the school involved in such cases. case of a circular stating that if there was a repeat of such incidents in any of the schools in the state, the state would immediately cancel the recognition of such schools.

Darshana Vyas, project director, Pathfinder International, said, \"The convention was held at Panhala (Kolhapur district) and was an attempt to re-energise the MSM community, strengthen community feeling and leverage greater leadership and involvement in project governance and implementation.\" She said that community-based organisations (CBOs) formed so far, have to gradually evolve into a state-level federation acting as a constant support to the community and giving voice to their issues. \"We not only need to ensure that the community is made part of the mainstream, but also continue and scale our efforts to reach the unreached.\" The convention was organised by Pathfinder International which has been implementing the Mukta project to reduce prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS among the most at risk populations such as female sex workers (FSW), MSMs and their partners. Now working in five districts of Maharashtra, the project seeks to transition the management and implementation of the HIV programme to CBOs. The convention held at Panhala brought together around 300 community members from six districts of Maharashtra, namely Kolhapur, Latur, Nasik, Beed, Pune and Yavatmal where CBOs have been formed. Various groups and institutions working with the MSM community such as Samabhavana Society, Samapathik and Udaan also attended the convention. The event included guided discussions on strengthening communication for behaviour change, raising awareness on human rights, entitlements and imparting micro-planning, leadership and team-building skills. Sameer Kumta, from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that supports HIV prevention programmes in the districts, underlined the need for leadership from within the community and called upon the members to take ownership of the work and share responsibilities. \"It is only through collective efforts that we can address newer challenges, while contributing effectively towards bringing down the HIV prevalence rates,\" he said, adding that the convention was a platform to rethink the communication, leadership and management strategies for a stronger community-led HIV response. Kumar (name changed) a Kolhapur-based peer educator, said, \"Coming together proved helpful in understanding how we can collectively address issues such as adherence to ART, consistent condom use, diagnosis and treatment of STIs, voluntary HIV testing, etc. We hope to carry home learnings from this workshop and use it to reach out to the community at our level.\" In the session on legal literacy, participants were informed about rights of the community and applicable legal provisions. Raju, another MSM from Latur, while sharing his learning from the session, said there are some laws that criminalise sexual acts between members of the same sex. \"We must collectively challenge such laws and policies that abuse human rights and limit fundamental freedom,\" he said. Pathfinder International has facilitated FSW and MSM CBOs in Kolhapur, Latur, Nashik, Beed, Pune and Yavatmal districts and has successfully handed over six district interventions to the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society as part of the third phase of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP III). The project has been successful in decreasing STI rates among FSWs and MSM by over 30% in the last five years. The convention, Saptarang (Rainbow), held at Panhala brought together around 300 community members from Kolhapur, Latur, Nashik, Beed, Pune."}

Between June 2007 and March 2011, CHAHA reached out to a total of 64,056 children and families affected by HIV and AIDS in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Manipur. Out of these, 38% of families were found to be headed by women, many of who had to turn to prostitution to sustain their families. \"There were a total of 21,000 HIV positive children in the ten districts of Maharashtra, 52% of which had lost one of their parents to the disease and 17% had lost both their parents. The numbers were higher than that of the other three states,\" said Manoj Pardeshi, general secretary of Network of Maharashtra for people living with HIV. It was also found that the status of children remains unknown especially after the death of their parents. \"It is only when the child gets an infection and falls ill, that he/she is taken to a hospital and it is there that their HIV status is found out. Because of the delay in detection, most of the time, even the treatment is delayed,\" said Sonal Mehta from HIV/AIDS Alliance India. \"A total of 13,001 children were encouraged to go for HIV tests by the programme, of which about 11% were found to be positive,\" she added. The programme found that the needs of the HIV positive people were different and everything could not be provided by the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres. \"For example, those children who were young are now growing up to be adolescents. Their needs are different and they have to be counselled differently from the ten-year-olds\u2019\u201d. In an ART centre, which provides the medicine, this kind of counselling is not available.

But since the value of dollars fell, the funds have got over in three years itself. We have asked for help from the National AIDS Control Program (NACO) and the Central government,\" Patel said."}

The recently released data of people, who donated blood in the last one financial year in the entire state, shows that among the donors as many as 819 were HIV positive. These people are not aware of the fact that they are carriers of the virus. All donated bloods are subjected to laboratory tests and if found HIV positive, are completely destroyed.

Altogether 12 districts Jaipur, Ajmer, Alwar, Tonk, Udaipur, Dungarpur, Banswara, Chittorgarh, Rajsamand, Jodhpur, Barmer and Sriganganagar have been identified as high prevalent and around 80 artistes will campaign in these places during the drive organised by the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society. \"The awareness drive would touch entire state but we have identified these districts for our awareness drive in the first phase as cases of AIDS are higher in the 12 districts identified in comparison to the other districts of the state.

The order mentions the category of patients who can procure blood and its components free of charges. The category also includes destitute, patients from below poverty line, pregnant women admitted under the Janani Suraksha Yojana, prisoners and disabled. \"The decision aims to cut procedural crap to save the lives of persons in need,'' Mani Prasad Mishra, special secretary, who issued the GO, said.

A sum of Rs 200 has been fixed for a unit of fresh frozen plasma and random donor platelets concentrate. Blood component,cryoprecipitate, would be available at Rs 100. A universal rate of Rs 850 for blood and its components was fixed by National Blood Transfusion Committee (NBTC) in April 2008. However, the decision invited ire, specially when seen in the context of government and NACO supported blood banks. \"The logic was that NACO was already giving funds to support the blood banks while the patients coming at these centres mainly hailed from poorer sections of the society,'' shared a member. The NBTC recommendation for universal charge said that the rates could be subsidised further after approval from its state counterpart -- SBTC. Using its power, the rates of blood in UP came down to Rs 250 for patients undergoing treatment in the hospitals while Rs 500 for other patients. The new order has slashed the rates further.

Singh is on the run and police suspect he could be operating more such clubs and masseur centres from other areas of west Delhi like Vikaspuri. \u201cIf we find the gang was operating across the city and the country, we could charge them under MCOCA,\u201d said a police officer. Police said this particular gang had been operating the racket for the past one year and was making over Rs 1.5 lakh every day by duping callers. The crime branch had on Saturday busted this gang in Janakpuri and arrested 25 people, including 20 women. Police said Singh was paying about Rs 75,000 rent every month for three offices in Janakpuri and had cheated people in several states, including, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. In the case of friendship clubs, the caller would be asked to get himself registered by depositing Rs 1,000 in a bank account. Once the caller registers himself, he would be offered three categories of women contacts for being friends \u2014 models for Rs 7,000, college girls for Rs 5,000 and housewives for Rs 3,000. Once the amount was transferred by the caller, Singh would withdraw it using ATM cards and the women would stop taking the calls. For masseur training centres, they only entertained male callers. \u201cThey would be told that they would not only teach them how to become a masseur, but also provide a list of clients. The callers would be asked to pay Rs 1,000 as registration fee, Rs 3,750 for the massage kit and Rs 7,000 for the lady trainer,\u201d said Chand."}

If all goes well, another such marriage, this time inter-caste, will take place in the state soon. In the May 13 marriage at Radhakrishna temple in Unit VIII, the bride was a widow from Ranapur block in Nayagarh district who had lost her husband to the killer disease around a year after her marriage in 2006. The groom was another HIV+ youth of Chandaka village on the city outskirts who had left home after he discovered his HIV+ status. \"This is my second marriage and a new beginning of life,\" said the woman who did not want to be named. \"I was pregnant when my first husband died. My child died a few months after birth. I was diagnosed with HIV during an illness after that and I realized the cause of my husband's and child's death. Life was hell,\" said the bride.

That is why I returned home and started a dhaba to support my would be wife.\" KNP+ president Prabhasini Pradhan said the major focus of the support group was facilitating the marriage of HIV infected people and giving them a new lease of life. \"We have been functioning like a marriage bureau to facilitate bride and groom hunting among the positive people,\" she said. Pradhan said KNP+ had arranged a meeting between the family members of a Titilagarh youth with that of a widow in Puri recently. \"Both families are very keen about the marriage prospects though they are from different castes,\" Pradhan said.

Vyom Parashar, a research scholar at AU, has developed a method to transform the extract of the weed of Congress grass into silver nanoparticles which may kill different microbes. Silver nanoparticles are the metal of choice as they hold the promise to kill microbes effectively as these microbes generally have a harder time developing resistance to silver than they do to antibiotics, said Vyom, a research scholar under Prof Avinash C Pandey. His finding has been published in Digest Journal of Nanomaterials and Biostructure besides getting a mention in 14 researches done worldwide. Further, Vyom has been asked by Elsevier, a reputed science journal, to write a book and a chapter on usage of biotechnology in the field of nanoscience. Giving more details, Vyom said, \u201cThe methodology of converting the leaf of this weed is simple. The extract of the leaf is added to a solution of silver nitrate and within minutes the entire solution turns into silver nanoparticles. Since, the method used for synthesis of these nanoparticles does not use any added chemicals, it is a cost effective and environmental friendly method.\u201d Congress grass was introduced in India in 1956. It causes contact dermatitis in livestock and is reported to be poisonous to sheep. Humans too are affected by this weed with respiratory malfunction and dermatitis. He said the congress grass would make the farmers reap huge profits as the cost of synthesising one litre of silver nanoparticle is around just Rs 30 whereas the end product can fetch upto Rs 3.5 lakh in the international market. About the methodology, Vyom explained that leaves of congress grass were thoroughly washed thrice in distilled water for 15 min, dried, cut into fine pieces and were boiled with 100 ml of sterile distilled water up to 5 min and were filtered. A team of scientist from various universities of US, including the department of chemical engineering, University of Texas, have reported that silver nanoparticles interact with HIV-1 virus which inhibit the virus from binding to its host cells. Parthenium is responsible for the largest number of skin inflammation cases caused by contact with the plants surface, said Vyom. \u201cI experimented with carrot grass as the pollen grains cause diseases like eczema, asthma and dermatitis.\u201d he added."}

The statistics show that most of the prisoners among these 340 HIV positive prisoners are intravenous drug users. These prisoners are getting free treatment from jail authorities under the de-addition programme called OST (Opioid Substitution Treatment). Jail sources said that prisoners did not know about their HIV status earlier and when they came to know about such programme in Tihar, they joined the centre. Officials say six to eight percent population of Tihar is HIV positive, but it is a fluctuating figure. \u201cPresently, there are 11,800 prisoners in Tihar and this number keeps on fluctuating. So, HIV positive prisoners\u2019 status is also variable because people come and go and they get treatment while being lodged here. All those at the centre have benefited,\u201d said Sunil Gupta, Tihar spokesperson. In the last three years, around 5,700 prisoners, who have taken drugs at least once in life, have undergone tests at this centre. Before June 2008 Tihar jail had no mechanism to identify the HIV positive inmates and whenever any government agency of National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) asked the authorities, a rough figure was provided. In June 2008, Integrated Counseling and Testing Centre was opened at Tihar with the help of NACO. Sunil Gupta said that they have been able to identify such large number of HIV positive prisoners inside only through ICTC and they all were affected with it before they came here. Officials said that out of 340 prisoners, 210 are intravenous drug users who have once in their life used injections to consume drugs and they have been repeat offenders in drug abuse. He added that medicines under the treatment of HIV positive are very costly and jail authorities provide these medicines for free to the affected inmates apart from counseling. Earlier, authorities used to send the suspected HIV positive prisoners to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital for treatment but ICTC is located in jail itself with dedicated counselors. The centre provides treatment with the help of United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), NGOs and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Gupta said they are providing this treatment to all identified HIV positive inmates so that they don\u2019t spread this disease when they are released on bail. Officials said that Tihar is also the only jail in India which is providing OST treatment to prisoners who are drug addicts and could be affected with HIV."}

Little work has happened since then. \"As many organisations, both public and private, are involved, mobilisation of funds and co-ordination between different organisations have been challenges in executing the project,\" sources in the state health department told The Times Of India. The nursing institute a unique public-private partnership venture with state-of-the-art facilities was dedicated to train nurses providing healthcare to HIV+ve patients in the country. A joint venture of the Union ministry of health and family welfare, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS), Indian Nursing Council, William J Clinton Foundation and Yale University, the institute was slated to come up on a five-acre plot near the National Institute of Siddha at the Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine (GHTM). The idea to set up such an institute, according to sources, was that the GHTM is not only a centre of excellence for treating HIV+ve persons in the country but is also the largest hospital in giving treatment for these patients in the country. At present, the hospital gives treatment for around 4,000 HIV+ve persons. \"The institute was also aimed to act as a national hub for nursing, research and training in HIV/AIDS-related cases,\" sources added. As per plan, the union health ministry has given Rs 5 crore as seed money for the Rs 28-crore project. The Clinton Foundation is responsible for raising the rest of the funds, and Yale University will provide expertise in training. On its part, the state government through TANSACS has given the land for the institute. The feasibility study for the project was done in 2006 by the Union health ministry through NACO. At present, the state has around 10% of the total HIV affected persons in the country and ranks fourth after Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka. There is a shortage of 15 lakh nurses in the public health sector in India. During the 11th Plan, the Centre had allotted Rs. 3,900 crore to the nursing sector alone for building human resources, expanding infrastructure and creating four centres of excellence in Chennai, New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkatta.

The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) report said the global rate of new HIV infections declined by nearly 25 per cent between 2001 and 2009. As the world marks 30 years of AIDS, UNAIDS estimates about 34 million people are living with HIV and nearly 30 million people have died of AIDS-related causes since the first case of AIDS was reported on June 5, 1981. It said about 6.6 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy in low and middle-income countries at the end of 2010, a nearly 22-fold increase since 2001. A record 1.4 million people started life-saving treatment in 2010 -- more than any year before. According to the report, at least 4,20,000 children were receiving antiretroviral therapy at the end of 2010, a more than 50 per cent increase since 2008. \"Access to treatment will transform the AIDS response in the next decade. We must invest in accelerating access and finding new treatment options,\" said Michel Sidibe, UNAIDS executive director. The report found that in the third decade of the epidemic, people were starting to adopt safer sexual behaviours, reflecting the impact of HIV prevention and awareness efforts. However, there are still important gaps. Young men are more likely to be informed about HIV prevention than young women. Recent demographic health surveys found that an estimated 74 per cent of young men know that condoms are effective in preventing HIV infection, compared to just 49 per cent of young women. In recent years, there has been significant progress in preventing new HIV infections among children as increasing numbers of pregnant women living with HIV have gained access to antiretroviral prophylaxis during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. The number of children newly infected with HIV in 2009 was 26 per cent lower than in 2001. About 115 low and middle-income countries are providing optimal treatment regimens for pregnant women living with HIV as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The report, however, said despite expanded access to antiretroviral therapy, a major treatment gap remains. At the end of 2010, nine million people who were eligible for treatment did not have access. Treatment access for children is lower than for adults. While the rate of new HIV infections has declined globally, the total number of HIV infections remains high, at about 7000 per day. The global reduction in the rate of new HIV infections hides regional variations. According to the report, above-average declines in new HIV infections were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa and in South-East Asia, while Latin America and the Caribbean experienced more modest reductions of less than 25 per cent. There has been an increase in rate of new HIV infections in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East and North Africa. According to the report, gender inequalities remain a major barrier to effective HIV responses. HIV is the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age, and more than a quarter (26 per cent) of all new global HIV infections are among young women aged 15-24."}

A survey conducted by the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) shows that around 20 lakh women become pregnant in the state but only 15% of them receive HIV test. Around 3.02 lakh pregnant women took HIV test in the state out of which 362 women were tested positive, the survey shows. The state government in cooperation with the RSACS has provided various facilities under prevention of parent to child transmission (PPTCT), including free HIV test for pregnant women, counseling on antenatal care and sexually transmitted disease, providing nevirapine prophylaxis to mother and child for reducing HIV transmission from mother to child. Information, education and communication (IEC) joint director Pradeep Chaudhary, said, \"We cannot force pregnant women for HIV test as it is against human rights. But we try to persuade them to go for the test as it beneficial for their children.

Krushnaben (16), Rekhaba (12) and Dakshaba (10) were daughters of a marginal farmer Vinubha Gohil, who is also HIV positive. The family lived in an isolated house in a small orchard on the outskirts of the village, where they had two bighas (12 acres) of land. The sisters consumed pesticide around 11pm on Friday when they were alone at home. By the time their father arrived the situation had become critical. He informed other family members and an ambulance was called though Rekhaba and Dakshaba had died. Krushnaben died at a hospital in Bhavnagar. A senior officer at the Gujarat State AIDS Control Society, Gandhinagar, said that the youngest of the three sisters, Dakshaba, was HIV negative. \u201cIt is a tragic incident as we had the family registered but the father had developed a false perception that the medicines were harmful as his wife had died during treatment. Her infection was detected at the last stage,\u201d said the official. \u201cVinubha Gohil even threatened to attack our workers who went to persuade him to take treatment. He is one of the 59,000 HIV postive patients registered with us,\u201d he said. Official sources said that there are 1,200 HIV positive patients registered in Bhavnagar district. \u201cWe are investigating the matter as the patients were registered with us,\u201d Dr B N Vyas, district programme officer of an HIV/Aids government initiative said."}

A large number of NGOs strongly reacted against the unprecedented homicide. This comes at a time when government agencies and NGOs have intensified their ongoing awareness programme on HIV/AIDS. Truck driver M Ibomcha confessed that he, in a fit of rage, had strangulated his wife, Rasheshori (33), on Thursday night, after coming to know that she was living with HIV/AIDS. A resident of Yainganagpokpi, Ibomcha has been living at his wife's native village, Saijang in Imphal East, for the last few years. He said Rasheshori was married to another man before him and she had two children from her first marriage. He added her first husband died of AIDS. Notwithstanding Ibomcha's allegations, there has been no official confirmation that the deceased woman had contracted the dreaded virus. Incidentally, Rasheshori was Ibomcha's second wife as he was separated from his first wife; he has five children from his first marriage. Despite Ibomcha's confession, Sagang locals strongly feel Rasheshori was killed by her own brother, Milan, over a land issue. Ibomcha is currently lodged in the custody of the Lamlai police station. He said his wife never disclosed that she was HIV positive though they were married for four years. He added she had a child in the marriage, but it died when it was just four months old, driving Ibomcha to become suspicious about his wife's health condition. Ibomcha said he recently found Rasheshori's medical reports and as he can't read, he asked a local person to go through them and got to know that his wife was HIV positive. Since his discovery, he was living with the dreaded apprehension that he, too, must have contracted the deadly virus from her, Ibomcha added. He revealed he had a heated argument on the matter with Rasheshori on Thursday night. Ibomcha claimed his pent-up anger gave way to violence and he strangulated her; he also disclosed he was drunk at the time. The local 'meira paibis' (women's vigil groups) and clubs, however, alleged that Rasheshori was killed by her brother Milan due to his greed for the plot of land occupied by his brother-in-law and sister. They said they'd frequently witnessed Milan bashing up his sister for the same."}

According to the study, a whopping 83% of the children covered inherited the deadly disease from their mothers while the rest were infected through blood transfusion. \"There is a need to prevent transmission of HIV from mother with appropriate intervention. Our focus should be to reach out to the unreachable so that the follow up is universal,\" said Dr Ivonne Camaroni of Unicef India's chief HIV section. The two-year study covered 18 districts across the state and mapped 1,639 children from 995 families where either of the parents or both are HIV positive. Of them, 857 children were found infected with the virus. North 24-Parganas topped the list with 124 infected children, followed by South 24-Parganas, with 78 children, while 72 were traced in Kolkata. As many as 65% of the mothers covered in the study did not receive prevention on parent-to-child transmission services during their late stages of pregnancy. Only 16% of the infected children are on anti-retroviral treatment while 75% of them live in areas from where they have to travel at least 100 kilometres to access healthcare facilities. Since about 72% of the families fall under the below poverty line category, most are unable to travel that far to avail the facilities. \"The report's findings give us a glimpse into the harsh reality faced by children and families living with HIV/AIDS,\" said Lori Calvo, Unicef West Bengal chief. The mapping, however, covered only children of parents who are members of HIV positive network. According to West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society (WBSAPCS), the state has about 1500 HIV positive children. \"This is only an estimate and does not reflect the exact figure. Despite efforts to eliminate new infection to children, there have been challenges,\" said WBSACPS project director Dr RK Vats. The report of the study was released during a state consultation on children living with HIV, organized by Unicef in association with WBSACPS."}

Representatives of over 500 NGOs from Gujarat, Goa, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra met at the two-day western regional meet that concluded in Pune on Monday. Besides discussing the performance of the third phase of NACP, strategies were recommended for a more participatory, inclusive, transparent and peoplecentric framework for the fourth phase. \"We asked the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) to ensure all processes such as budget planning, procurement and expenditure are made transparent and accessible to all. NGOs and the community should also be made part of planning, evaluation and governance structures and should not remain mere implementers,\" said Mathew Mattam of the Indian People\u2019s Alliance for Combating HIV/AIDS (IPACHA). \"We are questioning the programme design which on one hand prioritizes highly funded campaigns like the Red Ribbon Express, but ignores the issues of children affected and infected with HIV,\" said Father Jobish from Madhya Pradesh who runs a care and support programme for children in the absence of a state response. The delegates also suggested that short stay homes for HIV orphans need to be started across the country which could be linked up with foster families. \"The new design should be more horizontal than vertical,\" suggested Vinay Kulkarni of NGO Prayas, adding, \"the third phase of the National AIDS Programme was more target based and we were able to achieve success on many fronts. But while doing this, the quality factor got compromised. We need to emphasize on increasing the quality of services.\" Representatives of People\u2019s Health Organisation (PHO) shared a concern that often the community does not get quality counselling at the ART centres. The government is also unable to reign in private players doling out medicines to HIV patients without following the prescribed guidelines. \"All this will lead to a severe crisis and we will soon face multi-drug resistance with the ART medicines. And if that happens then we do not even have medicines to combat it,\" the NGO cautioned. Jyoti, an MSM (men who have sex with men) peer educator, stated that counselling aspect should be re-looked and moulded as per age and gender specific needs. \"Groups like MSMs /TGs (transgenders) should be dealt with more sensitivity and the counsellors should go beyond routine counselling for such groups,\" he said. Some delegates also suggested making counselling child centric so as to counsel HIV positive adolescent children. \"We have been able to reach out to only 40% of the population who are at high risk,\" said a delegate from Gujarat, Father Thomas. \"In Gujarat, most of the services are urban centric. Remote villages are still not covered and the common villager still equates HIV to malaria. This is the population that we want to be bring into the programme,\" he added. The recommendations made by NGOS will be summated as \u2018national recommendations\u2019 for NACP IV, which will be presented to Health minister Gulam Nabi Azad in Delhi on June 19."}

Forty women from Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Goa and Maharashtra participated in the two-day western regional meet held in the city to discuss and plan the fourth phase of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP IV). The meet concluded on Tuesday. \"We no longer want to be seen as recipients, but as designers and managers of health programmes,\" Sunita from Gujarat said. The consultations were initiated by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) that spearheads the National AIDS Control Programmes that are tagged on to the NACP IV design. It involves critical areas that communities and civil society want to get incorporated. \"The meeting focused on identifying the gaps in NACP III and identifying priority and critical areas that matter for the community which need to be addressed in NACP IV,\" Meena Sheshu, member of the Indian Network of Sex Workers (INSW), said. The group had hosted the meet. The community looked into the rights, entitlements and treatment issues in the NACO programmes. \"The group wanted issues related to dignity, equality and livelihood be included and prioritised in the health framework,\" Sheshu said. The recommendations made will be shared with NACO, she added. \"Our problems are best known to us and hence we want to be included in the planning process. Our voices should be heard,\" said Puja, a peer educator from Madhya Pradesh. The community was concerned about repeated acts of stigma and discrimination and violence against them by the police. \"When one of us was taken to the hospital, the officials put up a board identifying her as 'High Risk Group' on her bed. Other patients took offence against the woman. We fought with the hospital officials and the doctors. It is important that the behaviour of those in the healthcare sector changes. They must be sensitised,\" Laxmi, a sex worker from Gujarat, said. Another peer educator from Goa suggested that the new framework address raids by police and unlawful arrests of sex workers. \"We are not against the law. We oppose trafficking of minors and forced prostitution. Police action against the community must be checked by the government as it drives the community underground and out of the HIV programme,\" she said. The recommendations made by community groups will be treated as national recommendations. They will suggest the framework of NACP IV for the communities and civil society.

A technical team from the JSACS took samples from the people of 5,480 families of the Bishnugarh block of Hazaribag between April 2008 and May 2011, and found as many as 266 people were infected with the virus. Patnaik said under the annual surveillance conducted by the Union health ministry, Bishungarh block of Hazaribag was identified as a high risk group site and widespread survey was conducted by the society. Given the startling figures, the JSACS has opened a special cell on the block hospital premises to test blood samples and also to create awareness among people against HIV and its prevention. A large number of residents of this block, mostly drivers and labourers, migrate to big cities like Mumbai, Ahmedabad and its surrounding areas in search of employment. Normally, the labourers keep their families in their native places and develop unprotected sexual relationship with women suffering from HIV. When they come home during festivals and cultivation time, infect their wives vis-a-vis families with the virus. Residents said the number of deaths were higher than the official figures as the JSACS team has not visited many remote and Maoistprone areas like Kargalo, Purnata, Telanidah Saapmar More in Narki Panchayat. \"Out of over 5,000 samples collected from the Bishnugarh block, as many as 266 were found positive, responding to which a cell has been established in which counsellors and technical staff have been deputed,\" she added. However, the appointment of a woman counsellor remains on paper only. Though a counselling centre was opened here in 2008, till now not a single counsellor has remained on the post for the past three years. Since the counsellors are sent from Ranchi, the post continues to be vacant. \"There is a need to appoint a local counsellor who can spread awareness in villages,\" said Dr A P Singh at the Hazaribagh Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre."}

On Monday, Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh officially called for linking the country's HIV programmes and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme to help HIV patients get employment. In India, social stigma against HIV patients is tremendous, making it hard for the afflicted to get work. Urging ministries to have a \"HIV sensitive\" policy and programmes so that the marginalized populations infected and affected by HIV/AIDS are not denied the benefits of these schemes, Singh, while inaugurating the national convention of zilla parishad and mayors on HIV/AIDS, said, \"We have to ensure that there is no stigma and discrimination towards HIV infected and affected persons. No child should be denied admission in schools and colleges because he or she is afflicted with HIV or because his or her parents are afflicted with this disease.\" He added, \"We must ensure that no person loses his or her employment because of HIV. We must see that there is no social ostracization. We should ensure that women are not doubly stigmatized.\" Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad too stressed on ending stigma against HIV patients. Azad said \"stigma associated with HIV/AIDS is a barrier for accessing services and also pushes the epidemic underground. We are committed to fight this stigma so that people living with HIV can live lives of dignity and get access to education, employment as well as health care without discrimination.\" Azad said the government recently adopted a national policy to ensure a stigma-free environment in workplaces and enhance linkages to services. India is estimated to have nearly 24 lakh HIV patients. Though the adult prevalence is just 0.31%, the nation has the third highest burden of HIV, next to South Africa and Nigeria in terms of the number of people infected. The number of new HIV infections in India has come down to 1.2 lakhs annually as compared to 2.7 lakhs in 2000. \"This means that in the last decade we have brought down the new infections by half,\" the minister added. One area of concern, according to Azad, is the prevention of transmission of HIV infection from infected mother to child. \"Since this is a preventable phenomenon, we have to work towards elimination of this mode of transmission. However, there are major challenges in reaching out to all pregnant women for ensuring institutional deliveries for all the 27 million pregnancies that happen annually,\" he said. He added, \"To meet this challenge, on June 1, 2011, a new initiative called Janani-Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) was launched to promote institutional deliveries. Over and above the cash incentives paid for institutional deliveries at government health facilities, this scheme includes free hospitalization, free medicines, free consumables, free diagnostics, free diet (up-to three days in the case of normal delivery and seven days in the case of Caesarean section), free provision of blood and free transport to & fro from home to all pregnant women and their new born.\" The minister exuded confidence that the scheme would encourage women to volunteer for HIV testing."}

Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, while meeting a delegation of protestors seeking an early introduction of the HIV/AIDS Bill, refused to make any commitment on when the government would finalize and introduce it in Parliament. According to the delegates, the minister stated that the Bill should not have provisions for free treatment for all HIV patients. The chapter of treatment in the Bill provides for the provision of free of cost treatment to people living with HIV including second-line treatment, opportunistic infections and important diagnostic tests like viral load tests, which continue to be a huge problem. \"The chapter is vital and the government's refusal to include it in the Bill comes as a huge disappointment to people living with HIV,\" the delegates said. Around 200 HIV patients staged a protest in the capital on Monday, demanding that a Bill to protect the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS be introduced in the monsoon session of Parliament. At present, the Bill is with the health ministry. In August 2007, the HIV/AIDS Bill, prepared by the health ministry, was sent to the law ministry. In March 2010, the law ministry cleared the Bill. \"Since then, the Bill is pending with the health ministry,\" the protestors said. According to Ram Lakhan of Jagriti Network, \"It seems that the government is sleeping on it. It has been half a decade since the Bill was finalized by the health ministry. However, till date, the Bill has not been tabled in Parliament.\" Under the present HIV programme, though government is providing first-line and second-line antiretroviral treatment (ARVs) to people infected with HIV, treatment for opportunistic infections and important diagnostic tests like viral load tests are not available at the government centres. \"The Bill is very important as it puts an obligation on the state to provide complete treatment including ARVs, diagnostics and nutritional supplements to all HIV positive people. However, it seems that this legislation is no more a priority for the government and they are not bothered about the problems faced by the people living with HIV in this country\" said Sahil from Om Prakash Network of Positive People. Jyoti, of the Delhi Positive Women's Network and Mundrika of Delhi Mahila Samiti, said, \"Women are specifically vulnerable to HIV due to their socio-economic status. The Bill aims to tackle this vulnerability by providing special provisions like protocols for sexual assault and right to residence. The Bill needs to be passed in the Parliament without any further delay.\""}

OSACS additional project director Dr R K Nath on Tuesday said injecting drug users will get 'buprenorphine,' an oral drug, under medical supervision. This will reduce the risk of HIV transmission through needle-syringe route as those taking the shots tend to share needle and syringe, Dr Nath told TOI. To start with, the AIDS control body will open three opiod substitution therapy (OST) centres, meant to give the oral drugs, in SCB Medical College, Cuttack besides Puri and Bargarh district headquarters hospitals. A doctor, a nurse and an outreach worker will be stationed in each of these centres. The OST centres will also counsel the users to reduce intake of drugs so they can quit gradually. It is easier to quit buprenorphine, a tablet which the users keep below their tongue, Dr Nath said. The three areas were selected in the first phase because of a sizeable number of injecting drug users in these towns, the doctor said. Over 300 persons have been found to habitually inject drugs in Cuttack, 250 in Puri and 250 in Bargarh. The three centres should open by September-October, Nath said. The infrastructure is almost ready except for the Bargarh centre and the OSACS has sent the project proposal to National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) for its final approval, the project director said. OSCAS initiated the project after a pilot study in Bhubaneswar though an NGO. Over 75 people have tried the oral alternative in the state capital in the past one year. Currently, OSCAS has also been supplying single-use disposable needle and syringes to around 2,200 drug users in Cuttack, Bhubaneswar, Jajpur, Sambalpur, Bargarh and Deogarh to avoid needle sharing among drug addicts. Sources said about 3 % drug users in the injecting category in the state were HIV positive, while among the general population the estimated prevalence of HIV in the state is 0.29 %. As per government figures, the state has 3,117 AIDS patients at present. As many as 3,665 persons tested HIV positive in 2010 compared to 3,819 in 2009."}

In a major medical breakthrough, scientists from two separate studies conducted in three African countries, on Wednesday reported that anti retroviral pills tenofovir and tenofovir/emtricitabine taken as a prophylactic can prevent heterosexual transmission of HIV from men to women and from women to men. At present, ART is a treatment option for those infected with HIV. Now, the fresh results show that ART could also be used as a preventive tool. The Partners PrEP trial, conducted by the University of Washington's International Clinical Research Center, followed 4,758 sero-discordant couples (in which one person had HIV infection and the other did not) in Kenya and Uganda. Couples received counselling and free male and female condoms. The uninfected partner took a once-daily tenofovir tablet or a tenofovir/emtricitabine tablet or a placebo pill. There were 62% fewer HIV infections in the group receiving tenofovir and 73% fewer HIV infections in the group that took tenofovir/emtricitabine than in the group receiving the placebo. The TDF2 trial, on the other hand, conducted by the United States' Centers for Disease Control, followed 1,200 men and women in Botswana who received either a once-daily tenofovir/emtricitabine tablet or a placebo pill. The ART tablet reduced the risk of acquiring HIV infection by roughly 63% overall in the study population of uninfected heterosexual men and women. UNAIDS chief Michel Sidib\u00e9 called it a major scientific breakthrough. WHO director-general Dr Margaret Chan, on the other hand, said these studies could have enormous impact in preventing heterosexual transmission. In November 2010, the iPrEx trial among men who have sex with men in six countries reported a 44% reduction in HIV transmission among those who took a daily tenofovir/emtricitabine tablet. Scientists have for long been looking at options of pre-exposure prophylaxis in HIV prevention. \"This news will encourage more people to get tested for HIV, discuss HIV prevention options with their partners and access essential HIV services,\" experts said. WHO and UNAIDS say the medicines used in the trials are available generically in many countries at prices as low as $ 0.25 per tablet. Dr Chan added, \"WHO will be working with countries to use the new findings to protect more men and women from HIV infection.\""}

Flanked by a large royal contingent including his mother, who rules alongside him, four of his 13 wives and several children, Africa's last absolute monarch said men and boys needed to get circumcised to help fight the \"terrorist\" virus, which infects one in four adults in the kingdom of nearly 1.2 million. Studies have found men without a foreskin are 60% less likely to get HIV, the virus that can lead to AIDS. \"It seems fitting that our men and young boys should be given an initiative that will help them fight this disease,\" Mswati told a gathering of thousands in the southern town of Mankayane, where he gave his official endorsement to the campaign. \"This virus I shall liken to a terrorist. It is here to finish off our people.\" Mswati was entertained by bare-breasted teenage girls, troops of warrior regiments and a military brass band. Urging his nation to \"take care of your lives - stay away from activities that could give you the disease,\" the king struck a very different note from his pronouncement to parliament a decade ago that HIV-positive people should be \"branded and sterilized\". The US-funded circumcision campaign aims to snip 80% of Swazi males aged 14 to 49 within a year. Officials hope to avert 90,000 new infections and save the health system millions of dollars over the next decade. Circumcision used to be widespread in Swaziland, but was abandoned in the 19th century. The king likened the return of the practice to other traditions he revived in 2001 as a solution to the rampant epidemic: requiring young girls to wear tassels to display their virginity and banning men from having sex with girls under 18. When the king broke his own ban by taking a 17-year-old wife, he fined himself a cow. Since the project started six months ago, results have not been encouraging. Only 3,000 have braved the scalpel despite a massive advertising campaign.

The agency which collects the waste is at fault as well. They don\u2019t collect the waste in time,\u201d said Provash Chakrabarty, medical superintendent of the hospital. The waste is taken to Dhapa where they are sold at slums on the city\u2019s Basanti Expressway and Tangra-Topsia Road, off EM Bypass.

Drug addiction, multiple sexual relations, unsafe sex, quackery and illiteracy were main reason for the spread of the deadly disease among policemen, especially in the low ranks, said Kakkar. Earlier the department had paid for the treatment of 80 policemen infected with hepatitis and they have successfully recovered, he said. Refusing to divulge identity of the infected, he said many policemen never turn up for medical examination due to the social stigma attached to the disease. \"The situation is serious and there is a need for thorough scrutiny so that necessary steps could be taken for prevention as well as cure,\" he said. A Hepatitis C infected cop, on condition of anonymity, revealed that drug abuse was rampant among low ranks of police and many a times a single needle was reused for injecting intoxicants. \"Being an expensive treatment, none of the infected policemen are willing to get medically examined,\" he said. Kakkar said, \"Hepatitis C patients having high viral load were required to take immediate treatment of subcutaneous injections of Viraferon peg 80mg weekly, for six months. The therapy should be supported by capsule Rebavarin 200mg three times daily for six months. This treatment is monitored by series of blood testing and costs approximately Rs 2 lakh.\""}

Hospitals, which are supposed to hand them out free, say they don\u2019t have adequate stocks of these medicines. Officials of the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), the country\u2019s nodal agency for prevention and control of HIV/AIDS, said the sudden increase in the number of patients receiving second-line of treatment has caused the countrywide shortage of these drugs. Healthcare experts and NGOs fear this would increase the number of patients dropping out of the drug regimen, causing more cases of drug resistance. ART is a combination of highly advanced drugs meant to fight HIV infection and increase life expectancy of HIV-AIDS patients. If the first-line of treatment is not adequate to bring down the viral load, patients are given the second-line of drugs. Both these regimens are provided free of cost by NACO. Patients advised to take higher dosage of pediatric drugs In Tamil Nadu, only two ART centres provide second line of drugs. They are located in Tambaram in Chennai and in Salem city. At least 150 patients from Salem, Krishnagiri, Erode, Namakkal, Karur, Ooty and Coimbatore visit the Salem centre to collect a month\u2019s dosage. For the past one month, patients have been asked to take higher dosage of pediatric drugs or purchase them from the retail market. Second-line ART regimen consists of tenofovir, lamivudin, atazanavir and ritonovir. But ART centre managers say that the NACO has not supplied them with ritonovir. Krishnagiri-based G Karunanidhi, member of Tamilnadu Networking People with HIV/AIDS, is among those prescribed the second line ART medicine. He visits the ART centre every month to collect his monthly quota of drugs. On July 18, the centre gave him medicines for only four days though his usual dosage is for a month. \u201cThey asked me to come back to Salem after four days to collect the remaining drugs. I went back on July 25 and I was told they had not received the stock,\u201d he said. P Nagaraj of Salem Network of PLWHA wasn\u2019t as lucky. He was asked to take the pediatric ART drugs. \u201cThey told me that I could take double the child\u2019s dose. I avoided it as I feared side effects,\u201d he said. Experts say the drugs may not produce the desired effect unless they are taken at the right time and dosage. Dr Sentha Krishnan, who is in charge of Salem ART centre, said there were no stocks of ritonovir tablets. \u201cWe have not received supply of the drugs from NACO since mid-July. We ask patients to take a combination of lopinavir-ritonovir tablets. It has no side effects. NACO has told us the stocks will be replenished in a few days,\u201d she said. NACO's regional co-ordinator SThennarasu said the situation was the same all over the country. NACO's national programme officer (ART) BB Rewari confirmed that the number of persons taking second line ART has increased. \u201cWe have added five more centres to give the second line of ART drugs. We are doing our best to give everyone the medicines. Instead of buying from international companies, we are now planning to go in for local pharmaceutical companies,\u201d he said."}

Over the past four years, Asian Americans have had the highest increase in new HIV infections, going up from six percent to 10.3 percent. \"Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that the HIV infection rate in A&PI communities will surpass that of Latinos by 2015 and of African Americans by 2020 if left unchecked,\" said Tri Do, an assistant adjunct professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, in an earlier story. Only 10 percent of API men and less than one percent of Asian American women have been tested for the HIV virus. San Francisco annually awards $9.7 million in funding to organizations within the city that work on HIV treatment and prevention. But the city is rolling out a new plan for prevention \u2013 known as New Directions \u2013 which primarily funds organizations working with Caucasian, African American and Latino gay men, according to API community advocates. \"Trikone is saddened by the San Francisco Public Health Department's decision to slash funding for HIV/AIDS programs affecting the API community,\" Harsha Mallajosyula, advocacy director for Trikone \u2013 an organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people \u2013 said. \"Surveys have consistently shown that the API community is one of the most vulnerable communities to new HIV infections and these budget cuts will only curtail the testing and awareness efforts taking place in earnest,\" he added. \"Allocating resources should correlate with consistent data that places API community in high risk category and not on how visible our community is. The department's decision clearly implies that our struggles - as the API community - do not matter,\" stated Mallajosyula. The SFDPH has cut its entire annual allocation of $350,000 to the Asian and Pacific Islander Wellness Center, which claims to be the only organization in San Francisco working on HIV prevention with the API community. \"We've been funded by the City for 25 years,\" Lina Sheth, director of community development and external affairs at the A&PI Wellness Center, told India-West, adding that the organization would have to cut out its youth programs and drastically reduce its services to gay and bisexual men. The Wellness Center operates on an annual budget of $3.5 million, from federal funding and private grants and donations. The organization also does not have funding to provide direct HIV prevention to Asian American women in San Francisco. \"In the New Directions program, women are completely excluded,\" stated Sheth, noting that API women tend to get tested at very late stages, when they already have AIDS. \"As a community, we are very family-oriented, and the stigma of having AIDS is so deep, we wouldn't want to dishonor our family by saying we have it,\" said Sheth, explaining why more APIs do not get tested for the virus. The Indian American community needs \"culturally competent\" organizations to provide HIV prevention services. But Grant Colfax, director of the HIV Prevention and Research Section in the San Francisco Department of Public Health AIDS Office, said the City would ensure that APIs received HIV prevention. \"They have not been cut out of the budget,\" he told India-West. The New Directions program has allocated funds proportionately within ethnicities, dedicating the biggest allotment to high-risk groups, said Colfax. According to data from the SFDPH, Caucasian, African American and Latino gay males are at the highest risk for acquiring new HIV infections, along with transgendered men and intravenous drug users. Asian Americans represented 11 percent of all new HIV infections in 2010, and 8.7 percent of people living with AIDS. Colfax said his budget was based on AIDS data for 2010, and added that 8.7 percent of funding \u2013 roughly $844,000 \u2013 would be allocated to organizations working on HIV prevention in the API community. Asked to name such organizations, Colfax pointed to Magnet, an organization for gay men which offers free sexual health services, including HIV testing. Magnet, however, has no APIs on its staff or advisory board and its Web site featured no Asian American men. There is no evidence of an increase in HIV infections among Asian American women in San Francisco, stated Colfax, adding that the SFDPH is working to make HIV testing a routine part of health care screenings. In an Aug. 1 meeting with several lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organizations, Colfax acknowledged that APIs were a \"gap population\" and promised to look at additional options for HIV prevention for Asian Americans.

Others may well be on their way. National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) is supposed to fund these centres. In the two states, this is done by routing the money through Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT). Since April though, no money has come from NACO and despite many efforts, officials have not responded to NGOs and social workers associated with the centres. This has put a question mark on the future of 66 centres in both states. Many organizations running the CCCs have been spending their own money since the last few months and are no longer in a position to continue doing so. The centres provide anti-retroviral therapy to patients with provision for attending to in-patients as well as out-patients along with counselling. The first centre to provide these services in Pune's Sai Sneha Hospital has closed down. \"Ours is not a very big NGO so not much funds are available with us. We pulled on for about four months without NACO funds, but could not do it anymore so we decided to shut it,\" said Dr Sunil Jagtap from the hospital. Bhagwan Maske, who looks after the only CCC in Bhandara, is also facing similar difficulties. \"We need Rs 1.5 lakh every month. We have not paid our employees for half a year now and they say they want to leave. It would be impossible to run the centres if this situation continues,\" he said adding he was thinking of closing down the centre. KHPT officials said they have helped their partner institutions and tried resolving the issue to the best of their ability. \"Despite not getting any money from NACO, we have given Rs 50 lakh from to the centres that are in dire need to prevent them from shutting. We don't have enough funds with us for all as each centre needs at least Rs 1 lakh per month,\" Dr Mrunal Shetye, project director of KHPT in Maharashtra, said. \"We are in constant touch with NACO and are trying to resolve the issue at the earliest to prevent more centres from closing down,\" he added. He did not elaborate on what the issue holding back the funds was. He said his organization had approached NACO several times. \"KHPT was assigned to give funds for the last financial year. When the contract ended, there was no communication from NACO about discontinuing the arrangement, but the contract has not been renewed,\" informed Datta Patil, executive director of Youth for Unity & Voluntary Action (YUVA), that runs one such centre in the city. \"The money spent on the upkeep of the centres exceeds the funds provided most months. We bridge the gaps ourselves and have never raised the issue, but if no money is to be given at all, it would be difficult for us to run the centres,\" said Amruta Joshi of Bharatiya Aadim Jati Sevak Sangh. \"The money is donated by trusting people in the Global Fund against AIDS, TB & Malaria (GFATM) with the government being only a facilitator. I do not understand how they can stop the funds abruptly without any communication,\" said Deepesh Charles who takes care of the PHLIVs at Mure Memorial Hospital's CCC. The district programme officers of district AIDS prevention and control unit Ganesh Parihar from Nagpur and Sandeep Dhawale from Pune, though aware of the problem, said they were helpless as it was not under their jurisdiction. Efforts to contact NACO headquarters in Delhi were not successful."}

Rajasthan\u2019s Sriganganagar is in category A, while Alwar, Ajmer, Tonk, Udaipur and Barmer are in the category B in terms of risks and prevalence. Category A districts are those which have more than 1% pregnant women suffering HIV/AIDS. Category B stands for districts which have less than 1% prevalence and with more than 5% prevalence in any high risk groups (such as truckers and mine workers). The high risk groups include female sex workers, homosexuals and injection drug users. These districts require priority attention. WHO\u2019s regional advisor Dr Iyanthi Abeywicrame said, \u201cThere are many factors which makes Rajasthan a high risk state. The reasons include, people from Rajasthan migrate to high prevalence states like Maharashtra and Gujarat and return with the disease. Another reason is that there are 19% of all mines in India, employing over 5 lakh workers, most of them migrants. Also, every day 25,000 truckers travel through Rajasthan.

Through this regional strategy, WHO urged member countries to achieve universal access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment and care and to contribute to health- related millennium development goals (MDGs), particularly MDG 6 (combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases). To ensure this, primary healthcare needs to be revitalised, and health services integrated to strengthen links between HIV, TB, sexual, reproductive health and maternal and child health. The goals are guided by principles that include tackling the social determinants of health that drive the epidemic and also hinder the response; protecting human rights and promoting gender equality; and integrating HIV and other health services.

Through this regional strategy, WHO urged member countries to achieve universal access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment and care and to contribute to health- related millennium development goals (MDGs), particularly MDG 6 (combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases). To ensure this, primary healthcare needs to be revitalised, and health services integrated to strengthen links between HIV, TB, sexual, reproductive health and maternal and child health. The goals are guided by principles that include tackling the social determinants of health that drive the epidemic and also hinder the response; protecting human rights and promoting gender equality; and integrating HIV and other health services. A WHO official said countries must prioritise advocacy for reducing drug prices, train and sensitise health workers and minimise HIV-related stigma in healthcare settings.

Thalassemia is a blood disorder passed down through families (inherited) in which the body makes an abnormal form of haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.

She says that there's something dangerous about meeting a lot of people in life, \"because at the end of it, there's just a crowd around you, not a single companion you can fall back on.\" Anahita started working with a reputable domestic airline in the year 1999, when she was just 18 years old, and had worked for more than 11 years. Her marriage to her boyfriend of three years ended within a year of their tying the knot. Though she makes enough money to sustain her fancy lifestyle, and looks much younger than she actually is, Anahita misses having a family. \"I have men all around me when I go to a night club, but after the party is over I still come back to an empty house,\" says Anahita. The aviation industry is plagued with broken relationships claim marriage counsellors in Gurgaon, a city where many aviation professionals because of its proximity to the airport. According to Dr Nisha Khurana, a marriage counsellor, \"Around 300 cases of divorce and open relationships have come to me in the past four years, out of which 70% come from the aviation industry. A number of marriage counsellors in Gurgaon and Delhi, whom I have worked with, agree that the industry has a high rate of divorces, which is primarily because of the nature of work, hectic hours and long stays out of home.\" A typical working day in an aviation worker's life is spent either in the airport and flights, or in different cities where they have to stay over. \"We fly around eight hours a day and on an average, spend four days a week away from home. Even on the days we get back home, we usually end up taking enough rest before we start work again,\" said Captain Koustuv Goswami, pilot with Oman Air. According to a senior check pilot working with a reputable domestic airline, another important reason why people are lonely in this profession is because they give in to vices and infidelity which lead to divorces. \"When people around you don't frown on things like these, you gradually start accepting them as a norm,\" said Captain Rahul Agarwal (name changed), a commercial airline pilot. Captain Agarwal divorced his wife of 20 years after he realized that he was most unhappy at home. \"I love to have a lot of women around me, and I do.

Though the prison authorities had referred the death of Amulbabu as a suicide, an inquiry by the revenue divisional officer (RDO) concluded it was a case of murder. The RDO had also recommended criminal as well as departmental action against all the prison personnel who were on duty 12 to two hours before the murder. Taking the RDO report as well as a consequent government order into account, Justice D Hariparanthaman directed the state government to pay a compensation of Rs 5.4 lakh within eight weeks. The state government had earlier expressed its unwillingness to pay anything beyond Rs 1 lakh, which had been paid as solatium to the victim's family. The Pulianthope police arrested Amulbabu in 2008 in connection with a criminal case. Initially lodged at Vellore Central Prison, he was shifted to Cuddalore Central Prison on July 14, 2009. On August 4, 2009, the jail authorities claimed that Amulbabu had sustained grievous injuries after hitting himself against the prison wall. However, a statutory probe by the RDO revealed that it was a case of murder. The present matter relates to a writ petition filed by Amulbabu's father T Palani of Patalam. His counsel, P Pugalenthi, sought adequate compensation for the victim's family in view of the findings of the magisterial probe. According to his plea, Justice Hariparanthaman said: \"In my view, Rs 1 lakh as granted by the state government is general in nature paid for all victims of police torture as provided under the relevant government order. The said amount could be adjusted against the amount payable as per law to Palani for the custodial death of his son\". For the purpose of arriving at a reasonable quantum of compensation, the judge resorted to the multiplier formula as per the Supreme Court rulings as well as provisions of Schedule II of the Motor Vehicle Act. He then directed the government to pay Rs 4.4 lakh to Amulbabu's family, as they had been paid Rs 1 lakh as solatium on August 10, 2011 itself."}

He urged insurance companies to reconsider the reasons for excluding of HIV+ patients from getting cover. The IRDA on Tuesday had announced guidelines giving insurance companies directions on portability. According to the new guidelines, any customer, dissatisfied with the services of his insurance company, has the option to switch to another company and carry his track record. \u201cThere are no issues considering health insurance portability with the insurance companies and we have got assurances from all of them. It will surely come into effect from October 1,\u201d Narayan said on the sidelines of a health insurance summit organized by the CII. Elaborating on the health portability scheme, Narayan said that only two things would be allowed to be carried forward. One, the time already spent in covering the pre-existing disease in one policy would be given credit and a policy holder will have the right to transfer no-claim bonus. However, the premium of the scheme will not be carried forward and would be decided by the new company. The new company would decide the coverage details of the scheme. The regulator is also looking into the issue of allowing banks to sell insurance products of more than one player. \u201cThe committee on bancassurance has recommended that banks be permitted with two insurance companies. Right now they can tie up with only one. But the issue is that there are certain weaknesses in current bank insurance companies.

The scientists said they were unable to take the study further because mass production of the vaccine isn\u2019t possible. Across the world, most AIDS vaccine candidates have been unable to create adequate immunity in the body to fight HIV effectively, though they can be mass-produced. The first significant Indian effort floundered at because not enough quantities of the vaccine candidate could be produced for further trials. Scientists say this is a setback to Indian efforts to develop an indigenous AIDS vaccine. Researchers will now have to look for fresh candidates. \u201cWe are back to where it all began,\u201d said Dr Rajat Goyal, country head, International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. The National Institute of Research in Tuberculosis in Chennai and National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) spearheaded the phase 1 trial of the MVA (Modified Vaccinia Anacara)-based vaccine candidate (TBC-M4).The effort was part of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. The vector-based vaccine was designed by Kolkata scientist Shekar Chakraborty. In 2007, the results showed that the vaccine was safe and tolerated by the body without side effects. But scientists felt they could increase the strength of the vaccine by giving a booster. This trial began in 2009 and on September 14, scientists told an international AIDS conference in Bangkok that the vaccine strength did not double as expected. \u201cIt is possible to scale up research. But we will not be able to do that because we are not able to mass produce this vaccine,\u201d said Dr V D Ramanathan,who led the research from the Tuberculosis Centre. In the MVA vaccine, six modified genes of the HIV are inserted inside a shell of weakened small pox vaccine. So far, the vaccine has been administered to 64 healthy individuals in two phases. For further studies, the scientists required at least 1,000 doses of the vaccine. Normally, in vaccine production, a source is created and multiplied. \u201cThe vaccine began to lose its strength as we tried to scale up production and increase the volume,\u201d said Dr Goyal.

The widespread network of the affected people was proving to be effective in fighting the stigma attached to their status in society, he said. \"Another challenge the health officials are facing is of ending discrimination in rural schools against children with HIV positive status.

Little hearts, but sunk by an overwhelming thought that death may strike early. They live in the shadows and prefer anonymity for fear of discrimination. And those who go to school are often ostracized. Nor do they get specialized treatment despite massive funds being pumped for HIV care. What\u2019s shocking is that their numbers are in thousands in Delhi. The city has at least 11,333 children infected with HIV. Most of them, nearly 2000, are concentrated in south Delhi and around 1,700 in the New Delhi area. Others are scattered across the city. The plight of these children has been highlighted in a study commissioned by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR). The report states that the nine anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres are not wellequipped and HIV-infected kids are yet to receive benefits of any government scheme. DCPCR has now sent its recommendations to the Delhi government for rehabilitation of these children. A potent anti-retroviral regimen helps suppress the HIV virus and preserves normal immune response in children. The study was carried out by ARADHYA (Action for Resource Development in Health-Education by Youth Association) over a period of four months \u2014 starting March this year. The objective was to map children infected by HIV. Volunteers collected data from the Delhi State AIDS Control Society, ART centres, integrated counseling centres, blood banks, private doctors, counsellors and related agencies to find out the number of HIV patients in the city. Since many cases go unreported, the actual number may be much higher. The report also mentions there are 68,369 HIV-infected persons in the age-group of 14-24 . \u201cWe received complaints about discrimination of HIVinfected children in schools. It was then that we decided to collect data on these children. There are at least 77,000 kids below 14 years of age in the country who are HIV-infected . Over 11,000 are in Delhi alone,\u201d said M M Vidyarthi, member, DCPCR. He also said most kids contract HIV from their mothers. Many of those registered for treatment hail from migrant families. Since many of them don\u2019t have identity or residential proofs, they lose out on welfare schemes. HIV-infected kids orphaned by AIDS do not even have a means of livelihood. \u201cThough most parents are sensitive towards their children , they don\u2019t put them through institutional medical care for fear of discrimination ,\u201d he said. The study also states \u201cthere are no proper shelters for these kids and they also miss out on schemes for specialized care. Also, the schools are not sensitized enough to provide psychological support to combat trauma .\u201d The focus group carrying out the study also met various families and found that the fare concession while travelling to ART centres promised to HIV-infected by National AIDS Control Organisation in 2008 are difficult to avail because of government red-tape . DCPCR chairperson Amod Kanth said, \u201cWe have sent our recommendations and plan of action to the Delhi government for rehabilitation of these children.\u201d These recommendations include setting up more state-run sponsorship programmes for HIV-positive children for primary and higher education, hostel facilities for infected children, separate schemes for HIV-positive widows, better access to welfare schemes and effective implementation of schemes."}

Saying that the invisible killer has continued to spread its tentacles in the Hindi speaking states like UP, Bihar, MP and Rajasthan, she stressed that the selected pockets of east UP and Bihar with high migrant population remain high risk zones in the country. Apart from Varanasi, Jaunpur and Ghazipur, other pockets like Azamgarh-Bhiwandi-Mau and Patna-Muzaffarpur in Bihar have a good number of migrating people who are infecting their family members and local population with the HIV virus. There is an urgent need to spread awareness among the high risk groups of migrant population and devise a strategy to effectively address the issue, she said. It may be mentioned here that the DG of NACO visited ART centres of BHU, SPG Divisional Hospital and DDU Hospital besides holding a meeting of UP NACO officials and other senior district health officials in the day. Stressing the fact that prevention is the only cure in this case, the DG said that eastern UP and Bihar states could learn from the experiences of Tamil Nadu and other southern states that have shown reversal in the trend with receding cases in the last few years. Similarly, advocating for establishment of more ART centres in east UP and Bihar, she also maintained that counselling, support and care services offered through ART centres including integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) and voluntary counselling and testing centres (VCTC) need to play pro-active role in spreading awareness. The overall prevalence rate of HIV infection has reduced to 50% in the last one decade, but still the figure is high particularly in the Hindi speaking states.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Mishra and Justice Sanjiv Khanna asked the government to step in and ensure that the patients, who are also the petitioners, are provided shelter and are no longer abandoned. Earlier, the petitioners had highlighted their plight before court and pointed out that the tussle between different departments of the government had resulted in them being rendered homeless. They had added that they were forced to live with mentally challenged women. One of the petitioners, Sreerupa Mitra Chaudhury, informed the bench that the five persons were being taken care of by her organization, the Shramik Referral Centre for People Living with HIV/AIDS; however, they were rendered homeless after being evicted from the building that housed the centre and had nowhere to go. Both their families and the government had dispossessed the petitioners for no fault of theirs and simply because they were HIV positive, the petitioners said. They also pointed out that the HIV/AIDS infected destitute people need a facility of hospice, a night shelter or a halfway home and long-staying home for survival, well-being, continuing medical care and nutritional support. The evicted persons, who used to work as labourers in the unorganized sector, need labour welfare centres for holistic single-window service for their care and support. \u201cIt is very difficult for the destitute, people of the street to manage and exist with HIV/AIDS infection and its numerous associated complications,\u201d Chaudhury said in her plea, urging the court to intervene. Seeing the gravity of the situation, the bench asked the Central government to seek instructions from the individual departments and government organizations like the National AIIDS Control Organization so that the affected persons get speedy relief. It posted the case for an early hearing next month."}

It is the pace with which subscribers are fervently logging out of the maniacal adworld they have to wake up to. The ads exhort you to do everything from not losing sleep over education bills to not ignoring hair loss, owning a home and not just a house, etc. But a technical glitch in the system set up to help cellphone users avoid getting pesky calls and SMSs from telemarketers is leaving users flummoxed, as they simply receive a reply saying that the National Do Not Call (NDNC) registry service is unavailable. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is being flooded with complaints from across the country about the problem with the NDNC service. Those registering for the service can either call 1909 to indicate which category of telemarketing calls they want to block (banking, realty, etc), or they have to send an SMS to the same number. The SMS has to begin with the word 'START' (without quote marks) and be followed by the number of the option to be blocked \u20131 for banking, 2 for realty, 3 for education, and so on. However, complaints started flowing in from subscribers who said the system was not letting them register on the NDNC. Puzzled authorities realized that putting a space between the word 'START' and the chosen number led to the program not accepting the request. For example, to not want calls or SMSs from telemarketers promoting a banking product, the user has to SMS 'START1' not 'START 1'. Achintya Mukherjee, of the Bombay Telephone Users' Association, said he has received several complaints from consumers who tried to unsuccessfully block unwanted telemarketing calls and SMSs. When asked about the demand that the program accept both types of SMS requests, those with and without spaces, Mukherjee said, \"I think this is the mistake of the computer program on which the system works. If the program can be changed with minor corrections, then it should be done due to the demand. But if a major technical operation is needed to change it, due to which the entire service will be put on hold, careful consideration is needed.\" A senior official with Dolphin, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited's cellphone service, said the glitch means Trai's new service has not been implemented properly. \"Whether there is any space or not in the SMS, the request should be accepted. Worldwide, such spaces are accepted by all telecom operators. I hope Trai rectifies this soon as the service takes seven days to take effect,\" he said. Sudhir Badami, a telecom consumer and social activist, said he has asked telecom authorities and the telecom consumer forum to address the issue. \"The 1909 service should accept the request even with spaces,\" he said. To unblock telemarketing from a particular preference, like banking, the user has to SMS 'STOP1'. To completely unregister from the service, 'STOP' has to be sent. Badami sent 'STOP' with a space and got the message, \"This service is currently not available from master.\" \"When I sent it without any space, it worked,\" he added. All provisions of the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations came into effect on Tuesday. DO NOT DISTURB To block telemarketing calls and SMSs from the following categories, SMS 'START' (without quote marks) followed by the number of the category to 1909. Put no space between 'START' and the number Categories are: 1: Banking/insurance/financial products/credit cards | 2: Real estate | 3: Education | 4: Health | 5\" Consumer goods and automobiles | 6: Communication/broadcasting/ entertainment/IT | 7: Tourism & leisure Example: To block calls or SMSs for banking products, SMS 'START1' To block two or more categories, SMS 'START' and the appropriate numbers. For example, 'START1,2,3' without spaces will block the first three categories To block all categories, SMS 'START0' A zero at the start, as in 'START0,1,5,6' will fully block all categories To unblock a category, SMS 'STOP' and the number without a space To de-register completely, SMS only 'STOP' without spaces Registration, changes or de-registration take 7 days to take effect Users can also call up 1909 and avail of the service."}

A corrupt counseller was arrested last week and both he and a lab technician, also involved in the alleged racket, have been dismissed from their job. The incident came to light when Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) officials in Mumbai were informed that outreach workers of an NGO in Kolhapur were trying to sell HIV testing kits. The rapid testing kits, which can reveal an individual's HIV status in less than 30 minutes, is provided to the MSACS by the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) for free. The MSACS later distributes the kits to its 578 integrated centre for counselling and testing (ICTC) centres across the state. On getting the information, the MSACS officials decided to nab the culprits. Once the investigation started, the officials found that one of their own counsellors, Raghunath Kamble, and lab technician Hemlata Patil were the masterminds and the NGO workers were mere mediators. Additional project director Dr Dilip Deshmukh, who helped nab the culprits with the help of MSACS officials from Kolhapur, told TOI that the incident was shocking and something that the agency had never witnessed. \"The culprit has been handed over to the police and a case has been registered. We are now checking if such a racket exists in other parts of the state,\" he said. District superviser of Kolhapur Niranjan Deshpande was the first one to learn about the racket. Subsequently, on finding that Naagsen Kamble, an outreach worker from Lotus Medical Foundation, was trying to sell the testing kits to private labs, Deshmukh sent some officials as decoy customers. These officials contacted Naagsen, who on September 19 called them to say the deal would be sealed in a hotel at Jaysinghpur, a small town in Kolhapur. \"As our officials, posing as customers, reached the hotel, they found that it was one of our counsellors, Raghunath, who was trying to sell the kits,\" said Deshmukh, adding that he offered Rs 5,000 for two kits, which can conduct up to 100 tests. Deshmukh then contacted the police who arrested Raghunath. During his interrogation, the counsellor told the police that lab technician Hemlata also had some testing kits at her home. \"Hemlata's house was searched and around 30 kits were recovered from her refrigerator,\" added Deshmukh. He said both Raghunath and Hemlata had been dismissed from MSACS. \"We have asked other agencies to be extra cautious,\" he added. A Mumbai District Aids Control Society official said following the latest \"bust-up\", they have given out stricter orders on the already stringent protocols about the distribution and use of the kits to curb any such incident in future."}

We have sanctioned financial aid of Rs 600-Rs 800 to around 550 people from the scheme for the destitute,\u201d Jarad said on Friday. During his routine camps in rural Thane, Jarad found that most of the HIV-positive people were facing a financial crisis and owing to the stigma, they were unable to take up physical work. Subsequently, in collaboration with the public health department, Jarad personally conducted a survey of the district. However, HIV-positive people were reluctant to come forward to accept financial assistance. As a special measure, teams were sent to the homes of 550 persons to complete the formalities for the scheme. \u201cWe sent out teams to 15 tehsils and identified the beneficiaries, provided them proof of residence, income certificate and civil surgeon\u2019s certificate. Later, we submitted the papers to a high-level committee, which quickly approved the financial assistance,\u201d Jarad said. In Thane district alone, there are 12,000 persons undergoing treatment for HIV, but not all, are eligible. At the state level, a senior public health department official said, there were 4.2 lakh HIV-positive cases. \u201cOf these, over one lakh are below the poverty line. The government should extend the Thane exercise to the entire state,\u201d he said. Of the 4.2 lakh HIV+ve cases in Maharashtra, over a lakh are below the poverty line.

Between 1986 and 2011, over three lakh persons have undergone the test to check for their HIV status in Goa. Of these, 13,913 individuals have tested HIV positive and 1,453 have resulted in AIDS cases to date. The number of male AIDS patients in Goa, between 1986 and 2011, has been more than double at 1,009 of the 444 females detected with the ailment. The highest number of HIV positive cases were reported in Goa in 2007. The number of cases came down to 1,019 in the following year and to 959 in 2009.

This increase in numbers can be attributed to increased awareness of the ailment brought about through state and central government efforts. Over the years, the Goa State Aids Control Society (GSACS) has set up Integrated Counseling and Testing Centers (ICTCs) in three private hospitals in addition to 14 ICTCs operational in government hospitals. An ICTC is where a person goes for counseling and testing for HIV. The person comes entirely of his/her own will or as advised by a medical practitioner. The ICTCs provide HIV testing with pre-test and post-test counseling, drugs for opportunistic infections, free distribution of condoms and follow-up counseling for HIV positive cases through field visits. The centres also provide testing, pre-test and post-test counseling to pregnant mothers who come for ante-natal check ups. Those who test positive are provided psycho-social support and linked to treatment and care."}

Now she is being treated at LLR and was diagnosed with eczema and initial stages of TB. A medico, who had recently got her nose pierced, got afflicted with leprosy. Experts say that excessive use of substandard and unsterilised guns can cause AIDS if it was used by an HIV-infected person. Body piercing has come a long way, from earlobes and nose in the past to eyebrows, belly button, lips and tongues now. But it needs care in the initial days to avoid infections. Most of the youngsters go for piercing at a parlour or from an untrained person which makes the situation worse, said Dr SK Arora, skin specialist at Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital. He pointed out that lack of hygiene and improper sterilisation of the gun used for piercing are the common reasons which cause infection. There are some people whose skin is sensitive, when they clean the pierced area with antiseptic lotion, they get eczema. ENT expert Dr Neeta Bhura said that piercing the earlobes and eyebrows result in common complications, nose or naval infections can be fatal. Nose infection could result in swelling and pain for a few days at the pierced site. Also, studs and rings can get caught in clothes, which can aggravate the problem. \"There are times when a stud gets entangled in clothes and pulls the skin, leaving one in extreme pain. So this unexpected rubbing can lead to further complications,\" she added. Experts also suggest that one should avoid going to random piercing shops and opt for experienced hands to avoid infection. \"A lot of ENT surgeons and plastic surgeons also do piercing, it is safer to get it done from them, as they understand the body system better. And more then that, one should know the Dos/Dont's to get a healthy and beautiful body,\" said she added. Side effects of piercing are: Nerve damage: If the piercing is not done properly then there are chances of nerve damage near the pieced areas. Contamination: There are chances of infection or virus through dirty needles. Be cautious, check if the piercer is using sterilised needles and equipment Allergies: These are major side effects of piercing. If your skin is sensitive you may get allergies or irritation.

On Saturday, two HIV positive women narrated their sordid tales in a media workshop organized by the Rajasthan Network for People Living With HIV/AIDS (RNP+) in Jaipur. They said that the attitude of their inlaws changed when they came to know that they were detected HIV positive. One of them, Manju, said: \"The brother of my husband badly behaved with me when my husband died of AIDS. They expelled me from the house.\" Manju's inlaws live in Tonk district.

She said her husband thrashed him badly when he came to know that she is infected with HIV virus. She was also expelled from the house along with her 7-year-old HIV positive daughter. The RNP+ (women's wing) president Mona said, \"These are not the only two HIV positive women who are expelled by their inlaws. There are so many such cases which have come to light in the past.\" She said that such women have to face criticism and they also get stigmatized. \"If the husband and wife both are HIV positive and wife gets tested positive for HIV before husband, then she has to face a lot of criticism and also her husband put a blot on her character. There are so many such cases,\" Mona said. \"The state government can do a lot for such women and their children. We have already submitted a draft of policy to the state government last year on December 1. But, the government has not taken it up. The main points of the policy was single window approach for integrated health services, insurance, legal support, access to economic resources, right to property, right to livelihood, nutrition and educational benefits,\" programme manager, John Samuels, RNP+ said.

The 200-page notebook has details of her treatment from the day she tested HIV positive. Five years ago, when her husband Raman, a rabbit-hunter, died due to AIDS-related illness what he left was a ruined house and five children. Muniyammal somehow managed to get a loan from the bank and renovated the house. Adding fuel to the fire, she was tested positive two years after her husband's death. The couple's sons left their mother once they got to know about her status. Now, with bouts of TB attack, Muniyammal has to take care of her two daughters, Pachammal (13) and Meenammal (11). Muniyammal's is not a lone case, there are many like her in the Achapatti Street in Kariapatti, a panchayat town near Aruppukottai in Virudhunagar district. Kariapatti has a population of 1.65 lakh. The number of HIV cases is increasing in this village due to various reasons. In 2008, there were only 17 HIV cases recorded, but in 2009 it rose to 55 and in 2010, it went to 58. There are 22 discordant couples in Kariapatti area alone. At least 45 people have been tested positive so far this year. There are three main reasons for the increased rate of HIV incidents in Kariapatti, according to Mercy Annapurni of the Blossom Trust, an NGO based in Virudhunagar. \"There is a sizable population of masons who go to Mumbai, Tirupur and Coimbatore for temporary works and return with the virus. Since Kariapatti is the town for all the other villages, transgenders from other places come in groups and camp in the town for commercial sex. The drivers of trucks passing by this area during night halt near Ramu Seethai Polytechnic in Manthiriodai for sex. The place has become a high-risk area now,\" says Annapurni. Vadivammal Kamala, another villager says she knew about her status only after her husband's death. Living alone in an old house without any proper income, none of her four children visit their mother. Frustrated, the 49-year-old even skips her medicine. And this, according to health-worker Muthulakshmy, is a serious problem. \"Social stigma prevents many from having medicines on time. If the patients are aged, then the level of frustration they are undergoing will be high. Many even skip their medicines due to this. We have to monitor each and every one,\" says Muthulakshmy, who has been working for the welfare of the villagers for 10 years. Even though none of the children of Muniyammal and Kamala Meenakshi did not test HIV positive for HIV as both the mothers contracted the disease from their husbands, in the later stages of their life, Rajam was unlucky. She was not aware of her status until she gave birth to her daughter. Staying in a rented house, she struggles to meet the day's end. \"I don't have a regular income. My daughter is studying. I don't know how to survive,\" she says. Despite being a high-risk area, the village also suffers from several a lot of civic issues. Drinking water, according to the villagers, reaches them once in a week. \"We get drinking water only once in a week. Our drainage is choked. Even though the previous government promised us houses, it has not been materialized so far,\" says Munisamy, a villager. However, talking to TOI, a panchayat official said, \"We are conducing regular health-check up for the HIV positive people in all the villages in Kariapatti. Free medicines are given to them. We will definitely look into the civic issues,\" says the official, who didn't want to be named. (Names of the victims have been changed to protect their identity)"}

Lending credibility to this is a study published in the Journal of American Medical Association in 1997 by a researcher from Pune\u2019s National Aids Research Institute, which put the percentage of women getting HIV from their husbands at 92. \u201cWe have to work towards a societal norm where couples insist on testing before tying the knot. Of course, making testing legal is not an option,\u201d Devkar said. This year, 2,027 pregnant women in the rest of Maharashtra and 385 in Mumbai tested positive for HIV. Over the years, the number in the state has gone down: from 4,783 in 2006, to 4,552, 4,162, 3,724 and 3,361 in subsequent years. This year, the number is 2,412 (till October). But the number is still around 3,000. \u201cThat means the birth of at least 2,000 HIV-positive children. That is how high the probability of a child getting the infection from the mother is,\u201d said Devkar. \u201cThe debate is between discrimination and the possibility of saving two lives.\u201d Many infected women support premarital HIV testing. Kurla resident Ananda (38; name changed) said: \u201cI have faced the stigma of living with HIV for 11 years. My husband passed away a few years ago. I was ostracized by my in-laws to the extent that they did not allow me to meet my son for two years. I got his custody only after my mother-in-law died. Both I and my child would have been spared such a horrible life had pre-marital testing been mandatory.\u201d"}

Activists say this leads to underreporting of HIV positive cases, severely impacting prevention drives.

In contrast, public sector hospitals conduct HIV tests on the 14 lakh pregnant women who are admitted there for delivery. The total number of pregnant women who deliver in the state each year is 21 lakh. The state says achieving HIV testing for 100% of pregnant woman is a distant possibility. This is because over 1,150 primary health centres and sub-centres still do not have any testing facilities. Such centres witness 7 lakh deliveries, but manage to test only about 50,000 women. Mumbai fares better than the rest of the state as the testing percentage is over 80.

Though there is a long way to go for changing the mindset of society about the HIV infection, the progress made in the last one decade has been encouraging and promising,\" said Manoj Singh, president of Banaras Network for Positive People Living with HIV/AIDS Society, a social and voluntary organisation run by HIV positive people in the city. Highlighting the change in attitude and approach of HIV positive people in the last one decade, he said that while HIV infected people were not ready to even talk about the infection a decade back, now, they have started to open up and look curious to know about the facilities and treatments available. The taboo attached with the infection is slowly diminishing and even the people from rural background are coming forward to share their problems and experiences, added the man, who waged a battle against the lack of awareness and social stigma along with a group of HIV positive people in the region in 2002. The organisation provides care and support services to HIV positive people who come for screening and treatment at the ART centre, BHU. It has also come up with training and community care counselling to sensitise people in the region. How HIV positive people are opening up could be also gauged from the fact that around 700 HIV positive people have already joined the network to spread awareness in the region. Manoj Singh is living with ART treatment for the last 12 years. The network has also initiated efforts like education support to orphans (losing parents due to HIV infection) and HIV infected children (5-14 years of age).

While the centre has already emerged as the only centre of excellence between Kolkata and New Delhi in the northern parts of the country providing qualitative first line and second line treatment for AIDS, it is the low turnout of HIV positive people coming for screening and treatment at the centre which is baffling the experts. It is the same trend everywhere in the country and the ART centre of BHU is no exception. Out of nearly 2.2 million HIV positive people, only four lakh (less than 20%) patients are receiving treatment at ART centres across the country. Unless, 90% of the targeted population (HIV positive people) come under the purview of ART centres, 'getting to zero' target would be a difficult task, said Prof Shyamsunder, nodal officer of ART centre, BHU while talking to TOI on the eve of WAD on Wednesday. It may be mentioned here that ART Centre, BHU is also the nodal centre of National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and UP state AIDS control society (UP SACHS). Apart from screening and treatment of HIV patients, the centre boasts of other facilities including integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC), voluntary counselling and testing centre (VCTC) and counselling centre for prevention of parent to child transmission (PPCTC) to intensify the HIV treatment and prevent its spread in the region. As per reports of ART centre, BHU, out of nearly 14,000 HIV positive people registered with the centre since its inception in 2005, around 5,000 HIV patients are receiving treatment at the centre. The low figure is enough to baffle experts especially when the centre caters wide range of populations coming from eastern UP along with neighbouring states of Bihar, MP, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand in the country. Attributing the low turnout at the ART centre to lack of awareness and social stigma attached to HIV infection, the nodal officer of centre also emphasised that massive awareness campaigns are needed to bring people out at the centre and use the facilities. It is one of the most successful and cost-effective government health programmes, which promises to increase the life-span of HIV patient up to 20 years. \"A collective effort and awareness campaign targeting vulnerable sections could cause the difference besides bringing HIV people at the centre,\" he said."}

But health experts in the state are not heaving a sigh of relief as there is a steady increase in the number of youths contracting Aids, posing a threat to the health scene here. A decade ago, around 3,000-4.000 new cases used to be registered in a year. This has now come down to around 1,000. It is estimated that around 40,060 people are living with HIV/Aids in Kerala, gaining a low prevalence status to the state on the HIV epidemic map of the country. But the National Aids Control Organization's (NACO) 2011 annual report shows that 31 percent of the people affected with HIV are young people below the age of 30. In Kerala, nearly half of the total cases are reported among youths, mainly because of their wrong notions of safe sex. Now, the highest number of cases is reported from Palakkad, followed by Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur. Concerned about the increase in the number of cases in Palakkad, the Kerala State Aids Control Society (KSACS) has chosen this district for its major programmes this year, beginning with the state-level inauguration of World Aids Day on Thursday. \"Since Palakkad is a border area, many factors, including the high prevalence of Aids in neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu affect the scene here. So we are planning to start new programmes with the help of local bodies,\" says Dr K Shylaja, project director of KSACS. The cases reported among sex workers have also come down during the past years, but now the general population is more at risk because of unsafe sex practices. \"Youths who are more into free sex and migrant labourers who are not aware of the severity of the problem are the new risk groups,\" says Dr Shylaja. Strangely, even when voluntary tests are being done more now, the general awareness about Aids seems not to have filtered down to the grassroots level. \"Strangely, we have not conducted any studies on why Kerala shows a low prevalence now. We also need to analyse why youngsters ignore the fact that prevention of Aids is not all about condom promotion,\" says Joseph Mathew, state president of the Council of People living with HIV/Aids in Kerala (CPK Plus). The coming days will see more awareness programmes for corporate employees, Kudumbasree workers and health staff to bring down the number of cases. Since this year's World Aids Day has the theme 'Getting to zero' focusing on the eradication of new cases, discrimination and deaths, experts are bringing in more effective measures to highlight preventive measures and ensure a healthy life."}

Earlier last month, the World Health Organization declared that since 2007, the number of new infections has remained the same, indicating a fall in the number of new incidences of the virus. The Nagpur District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) confirms the prevalence of the trend in the city as well. Of the total general population tested for the presence of the virus in 2002, 33.55% tested positive while in 2011 the figure dropped to 3.31%. Similarly, among the pregnant women who were tested, 1.10% were found positive in 2002 as against only 0.29% in 2011. Surveys conducted by National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) showed a drastic surge in the number of citizens who approached to test themselves for HIV. In a statistical study, 5,047 people tested positive for HIV in 2002 with 20% testing rate. In 2010, patients as high as 1,17,915 approached these centres with a testing rate of 2.99% indicating a drastic fall in the number of infected patients, according to the recent survey. \"The government has the facility for providing free ART (anti-retroviral therapy), counselling, medical treatment, white blood cells count and tuberculosis cure among other things. NACO carries out routine checkup and awareness programmes to exterminate ignorance about the disease from the society,\" said Ganesh Parihar, programme officer of DAPCU. He added that many 24/7 testing and helpline centres have been started under the banner of ICTC (Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres). \"21 standalone centres and 29 ICTCs are 24/7 helpline centres working in the city,\" he said. District manager of Avert society Nitin Bhowate said, \"Awareness about STDs and sexual health has increased manifold in the general populace, thanks to a rise in NGOs that have worked to help AIDS-affected people. Mobile vans of ICTC centres have enabled us to help the hard-to-reach population which is why the general awareness has increased.\" Another project that is being run by NACO Children Affected By AIDS (CABA) that looks after the children infected by AIDS and the unborn who may be genetically predisposed to the virus. Madhuri Giri, project coordinator of CABA, told TOI, \"We have received 180 registrations for treatment of AIDS so far and have already started treating 58 children,\" informed Giri. Though private practitioners also treat people living with HIV (PLHIV), the cost of treatment goes up manifold in a private set up. \"It is a common view that government hospitals are not sanitized and the procedure of registration is cumbersome. To provide a solution to this, we personally request and fix an appointment with tehsildars. We act as a catalyst in receiving consent from patients and to carry out treatment as early as possible\" said Babita Soni, president of Sanjeevan Bahudeshi Samaj Seva Sanstha that promotes access to care and treatment for AIDS affected people. Despite the optimism shown by most volunteers and activists, some believe that the cloud does have a silver lining. \"There are many hidden cases among the general population that are not coming out on their own. Many of them may not even be aware of themselves being carriers of the virus. I don't see much happening in that direction. The figures only speak the story of those willing to be tested, not the others. With their inclusion, the picture may not be as rosy as it looks,\" said Anand Changrani, project director of Saarthi Trust, an NGO working for the LGBTQ community in the city."}

This was highlighted in the doctoral thesis titled 'Attitude and behavior of social, religious and political leaders towards people living with HIV/AIDS' carried out by Dr Amar Vyas. 150 religious, social and political leaders of Mehsana district were taken as samples in the study, which revealed that nearly 100 per cent of then knew that HIV is transmitted through unsafe sexual relations. However, less than 10 per cent acknowledged that HIV is also spread through infected needles and syringes, from infected mother to child and via blood transfusion. \"Unsafe sexual relation as a mean of spreading of HIV infection has been highly propagated but there is little awareness about the other three means of acquiring HIV. This lopsided awareness only contributes to the discrimination towards HIV infected people, thereby creating social problems,\" said Dr Vyas. Dr Vyas who actively works in the field of girl child and HIV in Mehsana district resolved to take on the issue of creating greater awareness about infection when he came across a one-and-half-year-old boy dying due to hunger as he was not fed any food for suffering loose motions and vomiting since his relatives believed that since he had HIV, there was no treatment for the infection. \"It was the most heart-rending case where the child, both of whose parents had died due to HIV, was not fed any medicine or food by the maternal aunt as she was told that there was no treatment for HIV,\" Dr Vyas said. Dr Vyas said that leaders, especially religious and social leaders, enjoy a great influence over the common man and society as a whole and he decided to study the awareness levels about HIV and AIDS amongst them. \"The awareness levels were low but when we trained these leaders, they showed a significant bent towards spreading information about HIV amongst the common masses. In fact, many leaders also helped HIV AIDS people in resolving their issues, giving them grains, medicines and even helping patients stand on their feet. This impressed me and I have suggested a model of training religious, social and political leaders and using them for HIV awareness to National AIDS Control Society,\" said Dr Vyas.

There's precious little in them, barring a few unstable beds, some fitted with saline stands, and rickety chairs that cover less than half the dusty floors. The rest is frightfully bare even for a rural hospital. Here, in a cubby-hole, unsanitized chamber, where breathing takes an effort, a team of two doctors, with help from a couple of nurses, helped two HIV-positive women deliver babies this week. There was no hitch and no one refused to attend to the women or humiliated them. On the contrary, the mothers have been assured that the gates of Khanakul Rural Hospital, 120 km from Kolkata - where the feat was pulled off on Monday-Tuesday - will remain open to them for treatment and counselling. Prosenjit Pal, the lone gynaecologist at the hospital, had general physician Susanta Pal for company during the deliveries, one of which was a complicated C-section. They had an anaesthetist and nurses Amita Batabyal and Swati Pal helping them. Both women, aged about 25, are healthy and the newborns - a boy and a girl - are doing fine. Their HIV status, however, is still not clear. The team is proud of its achievement but believes they have just done their duty. \"We were just keen to help these poor women deliver safely. Without our support they would have been helpless, probably even ostracized by the community and left to die without treatment. Ever since they sought our help nine months ago, we were determined to shield them from all adversities and make sure they delivered safely. It was not easy but we managed to do our job,\" said Prosenjit Pal. The women, who probably contracted the deadly virus from their husbands, visited the ramshackle hospital for a pregnancy test earlier this year. To their horror, doctors found that both had HIV. They were immediately taken to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) and briefed. \"There were a hundred odds. Touts at the hospital, neighbours and the stigma of an incurable disease with its sexual connotation. But we were determined not to let these affect the women. We took it on as a challenge and kept monitoring them regularly till they got admitted for their delivery,\" said Susanta Pal. Regular checks, counselling and advice through their pregnancy helped the women gain confidence. The doctors and the hospital counsellor Abhijit Maity even counselled their families, convincing them that the disease, though incurable, was not as contagious as it is made out to be. And that they needed their support. It worked. The families stood by the women and made sure no one got to know about their illness. Prosenjit Pal then got about preparing his team for the delivery. Some hospital staff initially refused to cooperate but block medical officer Sabyasachi Saha moved in and made it clear that no one would be allowed to shirk responsibility. \"I told each staff member that they would be thrown out if they refused to work for the patients. There was no murmur after that,\" said Saha. As the delivery date approached, doctors tried to gather all the meagre resources that they had at their disposal. The OT was disinfected and the floors cleaned painstakingly. \"We knew it was not enough and that the babies were still at risk. But we left no stone unturned,\" said Susanta Pal. Last week, it was detected that one of the women had a complication that would necessitate a C-section. So, we had to be on our toes and called for a last-minute meeting to make sure things were in order. We were tense and excited at the same time,\" said Prosenjit Pal. The team camped at the hospital on Sunday night and readied for the first delivery on Monday - the normal one. It went off smoothly with the woman delivering a healthy boy. The next day was the real test. \"Our OT does not have the basic facilities for a Caesarean, which is why such surgeries are not done here. In this case, we couldn't refer her to another hospital, for she would certainly have been refused. Also, neither woman could afford the cost of a sustained treatment,\" said Saha. The surgery was a success with the woman giving birth to a girl. The umbilical cord had got entangled around the baby's neck, but it was successfully negotiated by Pal. \"It was a huge relief for all of us. For nine months, we had been waiting for this day,\" he said. \"The biggest satisfaction is that we have broken the myth and set aside all the obstacles, practically doing the surgery out of nothing,\" said Susanta Pal. Lab technician Saradindu Manna was moved to see the tears in the women's eyes after delivery. \"It reminded us that HIV-infected people have a right to live,\" he said. For 72 hours, the entire team, including the doctors and counsellor Maity stayed put at the hospital, making sure nothing went wrong. No special precautions were taken by doctors other than gloves, an extra gown and glasses. The mothers and their babies were given Neviropine to try and make sure the newborns didn't contract the virus. \"It's still too early to know that. We are keeping our fingers crossed,\" said Prosenjit Pal."}

He held that close to 40% of households studied also experienced deaths of AIDS members aged between 18-40 years and often employed. \"Many families depend on borrowings and are forced to sell land, jewellery, household items to survive. 75% of HIV/AIDS households made no provision for their children's futures,\" said Falleiro. He felt the state should come up with a mechanism to give equal opportunities to all, irrespective of HIV status, while firms should not fire employees if they can work and if colleagues are not subjected to any risk."}

Raphael Pinto was found drunk on a road in Margao and was shifted to the Hospicio hospital in a 108 ambulance. Shortly later, on November 1, he was admitted to the orthopaedic ward of the Goa medical college and hospital, Bambolim, where he was diagnosed with fracture of the spinal cord and neurological deficit. Pinto died on November 3. Registered as a medico-legal case, the Margao police were asked to investigate the death and hand the body over to relatives. \"Based on the address provided by the victim at GMC we checked the electoral rolls in South Goa and tried to trace his relatives, but the effort was in vain,\" said a senior police official. The police also announced Pinto's death in churches in Colva and Margao requesting relatives to claim the body. \"No one has responded,\" the official added. Sources said that as per procedure when relatives fail to claim a body police can cremate the body. But the police are unable to do this in Pinto's case as they have not got a no-objection certificate from forensic doctors at GMC. \"For the NOC the police have to state that they are not conducting any further inquiry and therefore a postmortem need not be conducted,\" said sources. With no move to get an NOC, forensic doctors have agreed to conduct a postmortem, provided the police get a cause-of-death certificate from the orthopaedic ward. Police claim they have written to the doctor treating Pinto at GMC. \"The doctor has informed us in writing that the certificate can be given only after a postmortem. Forensic doctors won't conduct the postmortem till Pinto's relatives are traced,\" said police. Says Mahesh Govekar of NGO Zindagi-Goa: \"We are celebrating World AIDS Day on Thursday and talking about rights of HIV positive people. But even today politics is being played by police and doctors over the issue of an HIV positive person's body. If the police can't trace Pinto's relatives they could at least contact NGOs working with HIV positive persons and ensure that the body is cremated.\" (Name of HIV positive person changed to protect identity)"}

Rarely do middle-class people like Sumant, who has a small business and a bungalow in Bandra , crop up. The picture of middleclass or upper-crust patients is usually missing from India's HIV chapter. They share the same concerns about the disease as patients hailing from other social backgrounds , but their distress has an extra element: the feeling of being lost. \"The poor go to government hospitals where protocols are drawn up. A system seems in place,\" said Anita, an independent copywriter who got involved in HIV/AIDS care after her brother was diagnosed with the disease a couple of years ago. But for patients like her brother and Sumant, the problem begins right at the word go. \"Even getting a doctor specialising in HIV care in a reputed hospital is not easy,\" she said. There is the perennial worry about quacks or undertrained doctors. Worse, said Anita, patients feels shortchanged . \"How does a patient know that the private doctor he/she is going to is adequately trained in dispensing the potent antiretroviral drugs?\" asks Anita. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a cocktail of highly potent drugs that is given in various permutations and combinations. Doctors customise ART treatment depending on the patient's viral load report and immunity to a host of opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis or fungal/bacterial infections . In the last couple of years, pharmaceutical companies have brought out newer versions of ART. So, doctors can use first-line , second-line or third-line drugs (each subsequent version is more expensive ). \"How can a patient be sure that he or she is being prescribed a second-line drug because he/she needs it or because the doctor gets a bigger kickback from the manufacturing company,\" said Anita. The middle-class patient is too worried about stigma. Dr D G Saple, a senior dermatologist who was formerly associated with HIV care in the government-run JJ group of hospitals, said, \"Most middleclass patients are embarrassed to go to the chemist to buy medicines (for HIV/AIDS). So, they either prefer to take them from their doctors or contact the stockists directly.\" HIV specialist Dr J K Maniar said patients get the drugs cheaper when they take them from their doctors. \"There is a 40% price difference when a medicine is brought from the doctor . So, it is beneficial for the patients. Moreover, why should a patient not trust his doctor?\" In the case of a chronic disease, doctors and patients need to meet frequently . Dr Saple said many patients refuse to accept that they have HIV. \"It is difficult for them to accept this fact.\" Mumbai District AIDS Control Society chief Dr S S Kudalkar said private patients could always drop by at public hospitals if they need a second opinion. \"But private patients don't want to go to public hospitals and be seen waiting in queues meant for HIV+ people,\" Dr Saple said. Dr Maniar pointed out that a patient who can afford thirdline drugs-costing Rs 18,000 a month-would be wise enough to know whether he or she could trust the doctor."}

Medical expert Sandeep Budhiraja says we can all stay AIDS-free if we follow safe sex practices and be monogamous. HIV stands for the human immunodeficiency virus. After getting into the body, the virus kills or damages cells of the immune system . The body keeps up by making new cells or trying to contain the virus, but eventually HIV wins and destroysthe body\u2019s ability to fight infections and cancers. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome . It is caused by HIV and occurs when the virus destroys so much of the body\u2019s defences that immune-cell counts fall to life-threatening levels. India has an HIV/AIDS population of around 1.6 million. However, the United Nations 2011 AIDS report says there has been a 50% decline in the number of new HIV infections in the last 10 years in India. HIV/AIDS transmission HIV enters the body usually by injecting infected cells or semen. HIV infection is usually spread by having sex. Although intercourse is the primary risk factor , oral sex transmission is possible. HIV frequently spreads among injection-drug users who share syringes. Women can transmit HIV to their babies during pregnancy or birth or through breastfeeding. People who already have a sexually transmitted infection are more likely to acquire HIV infection during sex with an infected partner. The virus does not spread through casual contact such as preparing food, sharing towels and bedding, or via swimming pools, telephones, or toilet seats. HIV/AIDS symptoms People with HIV often do not know they are infected. Many people do not develop symptoms after they first get infected, but others have a history of a flulike illness within several days to weeks after exposure to the virus . Early HIV symptoms could include fever, headache, tiredness , and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. These symptoms usually disappear within a few weeks. After that, the person feels normal and has no symptoms \u2014 a phase that could last for years. When to take a test If you have engaged in unprotected sex outside a mutually monogamous relationship or shared needles using drugs, take an HIV test. Early detection and treatment slows the growth of HIV. If you are pregnant and infected with HIV, you may be able to reduce the risk to your unborn child by getting treatment early."}

GSACS data reveals that 745 persons\u2014515 men and 230 women\u2014died of AIDS between 2001 and 2010, an average of just above six a month. Integrated counseling and testing centre (ICTC) counselor Supriya Arolkar said seven deaths a month is an acceptable average. \u201cTimely and better anti-retroviral treatment and precautions taken by HIV infected persons have reduced deaths.

While around 954 persons were infected with HIV in 2008, it dropped to 901 in 2009 and to 769 in 2010. He also said 105 HIV infected persons in 2008, 184 in 2009 and 154 in 2010 developed into AIDS cases. Up to September 2011, 536 people had tested positive for HIV and 81 were living with AIDS. HIV takes several years to turn in full-blown AIDS hence those who die of the disease would have contracted the virus years earlier, Padwal said."}

However, by this time, nearly 50% of the children born to HIV positive mother die. However, a new technique called dry blood sample testing helps in early detection of the disease and saving lives. Under the new technique a child's blood sample is taken from the heel when the baby is about six-week-old. The blood sample is dropped over a filter paper, dried and sent to the National Centre for Disease Control (formerly known as National Institute for Prevention of Communicable Diseases). Microbiologists examine the sample using polymerase chain reaction to detect the presence of HIV virus. In case the virus is found, the referral centre is asked to send the patient to the nearest Anti-Retroviral Therapy centre for a repeat test using whole blood samples. Prof AK Tripathi, head of ART centre at Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University, which offers this testing, said, \"More than 90% of children born with HIV get virus from their parents. The test would help in saving lives or at least improving the quality of life led by them.\" Keeping the same in mind, early infant diagnosis services were scaled up in the state. The dried blood testing facility is available at 32 integrated counselling and testing centres in various government hospitals and medical colleges. Medical reports shows 33% of infected mothers would transmit the virus to their babies in the absence of preventive treatment. This happens in three different conditions. First is pregnancy in which the infection is transmitted through the mother's blood. Experts say that the baby is more at the risk if the mother has been recently infected or is at a later stage of AIDS when the viral load is higher. The second risk period is at the time of birth when the baby is exposed to the infected mother's vaginal secretions ad blood. The infant is at the risk of disease during the period of breast-feeding as well. The virus has been found in breast milk in low concentrations and studies have shown that children of HIV infected mother can get HIV infection through breast milk."}

However, HIV does not spread through mosquito bites, tear, saliva, urine, by embracing, casual kissing, handshakes, working together, taking bath or swimming together with HIV infected person. In India, migrant population, truck drivers, sex workers and IV drug abusers are the worst affected. They in turn spread the disease to their wives, children and clients. # How to get tested: Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) provides free testing and counselling. ICTC centres are present in every district hospital and medical colleges. Those who test positive are referred to the nearest Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre. # Treatment: Once a person is infected with HIV virus, the virus can never be eliminated from the body. However, there are drugs available which can suppress the level of virus in the body. These drugs are available free of cost at all ART centres. Every HIV positive patient may not be put on treatment immediately. The treatment is started on the basis of CD4 count and stage of the disease. The treatment has to be continued lifelong. It is extremely important to adhere to the treatment to prevent failure of the drug regimen. # Who To Approach: The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) control programme through 35 HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Societies, and 269 ART centres throughout the country. The ART centre at MLN Medical College provides HIV testing, treatment, counseling, nutritional advice and AVR drugs to the registered patients. # Protection & Support To Children affected with AIDS: In the short term, National Aids Control Programme is reaching out to as many children living with HIV as possible to provide them with the treatment and the care and support services that they need. # In the long term, NACP aims to ensure that every child has access to the same comprehensive set of basic health, education and social protection services, regardless of their HIV status or that of any member of their family.

Remarkably, these six compounds have shown zero toxicity in fighting against HIV. The pioneering work, developed by Dr R K Singh of AU along with his research scholars and scientists from NARI, for synthesising theses six compounds is the efforts of four years of research work under the project titled 'designing and development of antiviral compound as inhibits of HIV replication' funded by department of Bio-technology (DBT) and Indian Council Medical Research (ICMR). The funding agencies had pumped in a whopping amount of around Rs 11 crores which was distributed among nine institutions of the country, Singh and NARI been given Rs 60 lakhs. \"The achievement is incredible as it has the potential to revolutionise the fight against AIDS as the available drugs against AIDS, including AZT (Azido Thymidine), causes side effect by harming bone marrows whereas all these six compounds are zero toxic\", said Dr Singh. Moreover, since the compounds have been indigenously developed it would help India take a huge leap forward in combating AIDS, he adds. The compounds have been tested on the cell line of HIV at the labs of National Institute of Immunology (NAII), Delhi and NARI, Pune, he added. The achievement of the team is the tedious research work spanning from late 2006 to 2010. \"After computational study of the structure of RT (reverse transcriptase) provided by Crystallographers, we synthesized 40 compounds out of which 12 showed perfect docking-a process which provide information about the interaction between HIV enzymes and possible drug molecule. Out of these dozen compounds, which were positive against HIV, six showed no toxicity whereas the rest had little toxicity, explained Dr Singh. The associated findings of the project have been accepted in 'European journal of medicinal chemistry'. \"The lead compounds synthesized by us have successfully cleared the scanning by the experts in this field after which we have applied for the patenting of the Six compounds and the process of the same is in its final stage\", said Singh."}

Heeralal Rajak, now 36, hails from Garahara village in Begusarai district, 150km from Patna. He was detected HIV positive in 2000. The government would not offer any medical help to people with AIDS in Bihar then. Things became worse for Heera when his Patna-based doctor left Bihar for good in 2004. Heera would then travel to Varanasi to take free medicines from the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at BHU. He also joined Bihar Network for People Living with HIV-AIDS Society (BNP+) and started helping people with HIV. It was in 2007 when Heera had taken two HIV positive persons to a hospital at nearby Mokama that he spotted Rani, a native of Saran district. A widow, now 27, she was all alone after her husband with AIDS died in 2005. Rani's late husband was a daily wage earner in Delhi. \"I inquired about her and came to know she was HIV positive and ostracized by her society. Anything and everything done by her, including food cooked by her, was a no-no for her family and neighbours,\" Heera told TOI over phone from his village on Thursday. Heera fell for Rani. \"I would often make telephone calls to her and inquire about her health,\" he said and added they tied the knot in March 2008 with the consent of their families. The couple's joy knew no bounds when their first daughter, Deepali, tested HIV negative. \"She was born in December 2008. We strictly followed the prescriptions of doctors during the pregnancy of Rani,\" he said. The couple was blessed with a second child in June 2010. \"She is 17 months old. I cannot get her tested for HIV till she attains the age of 18 months,\" Heera said and added she, however, looks like a healthy baby. Heera used to run a grocery shop before his health complications arose. Now, the only source of income for Heera's nine-member joint family is the pension his father draws from the railways as its retired loco pilot. \"We spent thousands of rupees on medicines every month as the government provides only first-line ART drugs free of cost in Bihar,\" Heera said and added he often shudders at the thought of what would be the fate of his family the day the railways stopped paying pension. BNP+ president Gyan Ranjan recalled Heera was hopeless personified when he met him in 2006. \"It's heartening to see he is living a happy life now,\" he said and hoped Heera's happiness would continue for long."}

This can be attributed primarily to the efforts of the many anti-AIDS campaigns promoted by the government and non-government (NGOs and private organizations) bodies. It is only through proper education and communication programmes that awareness on AIDS prevention can be created. Today we've got a few must-know facts about AIDS that will help you understand the condition, its origins and spread. HIV and AIDS: HIV or the human immunodeficiency virus is a lenti virus that infects the cells of the immune system and impairs their functions. Infection by the virus causes the gradual breakdown of the body\u2019s ability to ward off infections and diseases. Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), on the other hand, is the most advanced stage of HIV infection wherein, the body is infected by more than 20 opportunistic diseases or HIV-related cancers. History and origin: It is believed that the disease first came from chimpanzees during a hunting incident in the Democratic Republic of Congo during the 1930s. However, it was only in the early 1980s that the term AIDS was first coined and introduced. Originally, it was thought that the condition is prevalent only among homosexuals. But later, reports and researches made it evident that the infection can occur in heterosexuals as well. Statistics: As per World Health Organization statistics, more than 2 million people across the world die every year due to HIV/AIDS. Due to this, the condition is regarded as the world\u2019s number one infectious killer affecting mainly low and middle income countries. Areas of prevalence: The region having the largest incidence of HIV infection is Africa with an estimated 21-28 million people suffering from the condition. Apart from this, certain regions in Asia and Eastern Europe including India also have a strong proportion of HIV victims. Countries like Russia and Ukraine also have a large number of HIV victims and people suffering from AIDS. HIV-infection progression: The time required for HIV-infected persons to develop AIDS varies widely. According to UN AIDS reports, majority of people infected with the virus develop signs of HIV-related illness within 5 to 10 years if not treated at the earliest. However, the durations between the HIV infection and the actual development of AIDS can be 10-15 years and sometimes even longer. Mother to child transmission: Although infection can spread from mother to child, current recommendations indicate that this can be avoided entirely with the help of preventive medicines and procedures. However, access to such preventive interventions is low in certain developing low income nations. Another way to achieve this is by avoiding the process of breast feeding and opting for replacement feeding methods.

Those tested HIV positive are among 100 thalassaemic children from across the district who have been coming to the civil hospital for blood transfusion regularly. The patients arrange for blood, whereas the hospital does the transfusion. A criminal application has come to be filed through advocate Rajesh Dewal, in which it has been contended that following the incident, the parents filed a complaint with local police station. There was a specific demand that the cases should be investigated and the culprits should be booked under sections 308, 328 and 338 of IPC for attempt to culpable homicide and causing injury by administering stupefying drug or poison with intent to cause harm. The lawyer said that police authority was sitting tight over the complaint, and the parents were forced to approach the superintendent of police. But when nothing happened, a petition was filed in the high court seeking directions to police authority to investigate the case after registering an FIR. When this petition came up for hearing before Justice J C Upadhyay, it was pointed out that a PIL was filed by advocate Girish Das, in which similar relief was sought besides demanding compensation of Rs 5 lakh in each of the 23 cases. Acting on the PIL, a division bench had already sought explanation on the issue from various authorities including the state government, Centre and the National Aids Control Organization and director of Gujarat State Council for Blood Transfusion.

John and Mohamed Sayeed (name changed), a nurse from Ethiopia, both HIV positive, underwent successful kidney transplantation and are recovering. \u201cThe transplants, the first such in Karnataka, are considered path-breaking for two reasons: one, nephrologists are seeing a growing number of patients who need kidney transplants because of associated conditions found in HIV+ patients; second, for the HIV+, it is a fight to even find a place that accepts them for dialysis ,\u201d said Dr Lloyd Vincent, senior consultant nephrologist with Narayana Hrudayalaya. Both John and Mohamed contacted doctors of the hospital through email, after several countries denied them treatment because of their HIV status. After getting positive response from the doctors, they flew down to Bangalore. The doctors put them on pre-transplantation treatment for about four months. \u201cIt is not the surgical process, but medical management of these patients that is complicated. The patients need to be trained about side-effects of multiple medications ,\u201d said Dr Vincent. RISKS INVOLVED Although prevalence of HIV is coming down in India, 5% of HIV+ patients are at risk of developing failure of organs like kidney and liver. \u201cThis is because the affected blood flows through these two vital organs and makes them weak,\u201d said Dr Ishthiaque Ahmed, nephrologist."}

This follows the Gujarat high court order that a police complaint be registered in the case. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed regarding the tragedy on September 24. Those who tested HIV positive are among 100 thalassaemic children from Junagadh district, who have been coming to the civil hospital for blood transfusion regularly. Thalassaemia is a hereditary blood disorder which results in excessive destruction of red blood cells leading to anaemia. Hence, thalassaemics need regular blood transfusions to stay alive. There are more than 4,500 thalassaemic children in the state. The issue came into light about four months ago when 23 thalassaemic kids tested HIV positive in a surprise check at Junagadh Civil Hospital.

Meenakshi, who is in her 30s, and her organization, Kovai District HIV Nalla Sangam (CD HANS), have played an important role in encouraging HIV/AIDS-affected persons to come out and form a network to fight discrimination. \"HIV affected individuals face a lot of problems. We came out with this initiative so that the affected could have a space to share their common problems,\" she says. With seven people on board, they started CD HANS as a network of HIV infected people. \"Now there are around 2000 members in our network in the district\", she says. Today, the organization conducts peer group programmes, support group activities and other joint initiatives. She says that peer group programmes help patients reconcile with the issues related to the disease. \"When everyone hears each other's story, it helps them garner a lot of emotional support,\" she explains. HIV patients are at first put through a get together that happens twice a month. Then, they meet during alternate months. \"The frequent get-togethers will help people overcome the fears and myths associated. With anti-retroviral treatment (ART), an infected person can live a normal life for more than 30 years. Most would have panicked and lost hope of living after detecting themselves to be HIV infected.

Through self-help groups of the HIV affected, many have started their own initiatives.\" Meenakshi, who had to drop her studies at 9th standard, has since completed an MA in Sociology from Anna University. \"I did this to develop my counseling skills. Assistance and consoling from our part helps patients more than the effort of a normal counselor,\" she says. CD HANS have also arranged marriages among the HIV-affected. \"This year we conducted five marriages. We do not encourage it unless the families from both sides agree to their alliance,\" she said. Aji Mary Asha, a counsellor of the government-run Integrated Counseling Testing Centre (ICTC), says the efforts of Meenakshi and her colleagues are helping the patients to speak out. \"This helps those who feel depressed after knowing the disease,\" she told TOI."}

(Antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances). The hunt has begun to identify 100 volunteers belonging to a rare group of HIV infected patients who stay healthy for years without requiring life-saving antiretroviral treatment (ART). These antibodies in their blood are the ones that bars HIV from entering their blood cells and replicating, thereby progressing to AIDS. Scientists say these antibodies would ultimately reveal the Achilles heel of the virus and help create the elusive vaccine. This is part of International Aids Vaccine Initiative\u2019s (IAVI) programme called Protocol G, a global hunt for such antibodies launched in 2006. So far, blood samples of 1,800 such HIV patients have been screened across 12 countries and 19 broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAbs) have been identified. A bNAb is an antibody capable of stopping a variety of HIV subtypes from infecting their target cells. \u201cOnly a minority of people who are infected with HIV produce bNAbs. Although HIV is a wildly mutable virus, certain parts of it are relatively resistant to change. These parts are essential to the virus\u2019s ability to infect, and they are the elements of HIV that bNAbs target,\u201d experts said. Just a few weeks ago, department of biotechnology (DBT) cleared the proposal to roll out Protocol G in the country. It is being implemented by IAVI and YRG Care from Chennai \u2013 the same organization that isolated the first HIV case in India in 1986. The blood samples collected from the 100 volunteers will be tested at Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute (THSTI), which is being built in Gurgaon. IAVI\u2019s India chief Dr Rajat Goyal told TOI that \u201cThis is a landmark project for India. We are presently identifying volunteers, who are at least 18 years, infected with HIV at least three years ago but has not received ART. By April, samples will be picked up and tested against a standard panel of HIV isolates by the end of 2012. We will then know whether there is a population of interest from whom these bNAb can be identified and characterized.\u201d Careful study of bNAbs is expected to reveal vulnerabilities of the different types of HIV. Most importantly, scientists expect that they can use information about how bNAbs bind to HIV to construct immunogens \u2014 the active ingredients of vaccines \u2014 that elicit similar antibodies. The more such antibodies researchers have in hand, the more clues they can get about how best to target HIV with a vaccine. The project has tested HIV patients in Thailand, the UK, the US, Nigeria, South Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Australia and Zambia to identify bNAbs. HIV infects 7,100 people daily. The quest to develop an AIDS vaccine has consumed scientists for 25 years since the discovery of HIV. Scientists say HIV is the most mutable virus ever encountered. A number of different subtypes of the virus, known as clades, circulate in different regions of the world. Within those clades there is considerable variability, and, beyond that, the virus mutates furiously within the people it has infected. Second, because no one is known to have cleared an HIV infection, scientists do not know which elements of the immune response must be engaged to control the virus \u2014 and thus are uncertain how to replicate such responses. The immune system has a very narrow window of opportunity in which to neutralize HIV before the virus establishes a lifelong infection."}

According to Vinayak, supervisor of District AIDS Preventive and Control Unit, between 2002 and November 2011, a total of 9,883 HIV+ cases were detected. \"In 2010, 894 positive cases were detected, while in 2011 up to November, 942 cases were detected. Though the number of HIV+ cases detected in Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) has come down, the overall number of cases detected under PMTCT and HIV+ positive cases has gradually increased,\" he said. Dr Rekha, working at the Retroviral Treatment Centre (ART), said that after the HIV test was made mandatory for mothers in government hospitals, they found that there were a growing number of HIV+positive cases. \"This is because married women are the real victims of spouses who stray,\" she added. According to statistics available at the ART centre, 281 persons affected with AIDS have died between 2009 and 2010 in Mandya district, and 3,299 HIV+ cases were detected in the same period. \"We are collecting and codifying 2011\u2019s data of HIV+ cases,\" Rekha said.

This detective mechanism is good for two reasons. \"By this, we can easily identify a HIV+ pregnant woman during the prenatal visit and it will also help us to protect the child from being infected with HIV through the ART,\" she said. PMTCT has shown gradual increase on the graph of HIV+ cases. \"If there is no such detection mechanism in government hospitals, HIV in pregnant women would otherwise go undetected and their babies are at higher risk of being infected,\" Rekha added."}

The volunteers of GSNP+ have been doing rigorous work in every district of the state to mobilize young, widow, separated and divorced candidates suffering from HIV/AIDS to come forward and find their life partners. In Gujarat, only 12 per cent women living with HIV/AIDS apply for marriage proposals as compared to male candidates.

But, they are not willing to come out fearing social stigma,\" president of GSNP+ Daxa Patel said. Since the number of women is always less at the marriage melas, members of the fair sex get the privilege to choose.

National AIDS Control Organisation\u2019s latest figures show that besides high risk populations like sex workers, the highest burden of HIV is among migrants \u2014 3.6%, which is 10 times the HIV prevalence among the general population. With migration rates increasing, the prevalence will only get worse. According to the 2001 census, 30.1% of the population was considered to have migrated (314 million) \u2014 a considerable increase from 27.4% in 1991. NACO has, therefore, identified 108 railway stations \u2013 which are both source and destination of migrants travelling in search of work. These are now the focus of the country\u2019s anti-HIV fight. Red Ribbon Express (RRE), which chugs out of Delhi on Thursday, will stop at most of these 108 identified stations to test migrants for HIV besides carrying out counselling and spreading anti-HIV messages. During it\u2019s year-long journey, RRE will traverse through 23 states, cover 30,000 km and stop at 162 stations. Speaking to TOI, a NACO official said, \u201cMigrants are one of the major focus areas this time with the RRE. Last year, RRE stopped at 152 stations and reached out to 8 million people directly. This time, around 30-40 stops will be to mainly address migrants.\u201d NACO has identified 122 districts with high out-migration across 11 states which are on priority for starting up community level interventions. Another 75 important transit locations have been identified across these 122 districts from where these migrants usually board long distance trains/buses to reach their destinations. Studies on the relationship between migration and HIV conducted by NACO in three popular migration corridors \u2014 Ganjam-Surat, Darbhanga-Delhi and Azamgarh-Mumbai \u2014 threw up shocking findings. It showed that two to four times more number of informal workers had non-regular partners or visited sex workers with only 25% using condoms. Around 5% male migrants and 13% female migrants reported sexually transmitted infections, nearly double the national average. According to NACO, the risk of HIV infection for migrants seems to arise from a multitude of factors -- risky behaviour, lack of social and economic security and involvement in peer driven risk taking activities. In a recent study by UNDP (through Population Council), the risk of HIV among migrants was reported to be 1.68 times more likely than non-migrants. Majority of migrants are also often poorly educated, with majority reporting less than five years of formal education. This contributes to limited knowledge of HIV transmission. A study conducted in 30 villages in the northern parts of Karnataka revealed that 40% of single men and 35% of married migrant men had non-marital sexual relationships in the last 12 months. For a long time, India has lived with the belief that migrants are at risk only at destination sites when they are away from home and their spouse. However, recent evidence proves otherwise. Returned migrants continue to fuel the epidemic since most infected migrants tend to return to source when they are sick. A study of married men found returned migrants were 3.86 times as likely to be HIV positive as compared to active married migrant men. Among men reporting sex with a non-spousal unpaid female sex partner in the past year, only 19% of men reported consistent condom use. This impacts the women and spouses of informal workers/migrants at the source, making them vulnerable to infections from their husband. RRE has been recognized as the world\u2019s largest mass mobilization drive on HIV. Last year, around 80 lakh people were reached through the train and outreach activities. Around 81,000 district resource persons were trained, 36,000 people got themselves tested for HIV and 28,000 people received general health check-up services. Impact assessment of RRE indicated that the comprehensive knowledge of routes of HIV transmission, methods of prevention, condom use, STI prevention and treatment was significantly higher among respondents exposed to the RRE project compared to those not exposed."}

An NGO working in the state, Rajasthan Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS' president Brijesh Dubey said, \"At present such people have to travel to Ahmedabad or Delhi, which is very tiring as they are already weak. So, there is a desperate requirement for second line ART.\" So far 39 AIDS patients from SMS hospital's ART centre have been referred to Delhi's second line ART centre. At present, 10 out of them are still on second line ART drugs. Assistant to nodal officer ART, SMS hospital, Dr Harsh Vardhan, said, \"The survival rate at second line ART is more than 65%. It is very necessary to put a person resistant to first line drugs on second line to save his life. The medicines used are very expensive, they, too, will be provided free of cost at the centre.\" Sources said the groundwork for opening the second line centre at SMS hospital has been completed as doctors have been trained and some medicines have also arrived. A meeting of the department officials will be held soon to announce the date of opening of the centre."}

On Saturday, at the international symposium on HIV and Infectious diseases organized by the YRG Care here, experts said there was a need for youngsters to get into basic and applied research in HIV/AIDS. \"It's been 25 years since we first diagnosed HIV in this country. But the number of research papers that have come out of our country is abysmally low,\" said Dr Suniti Solomon, who diagnosed the first HIV/AIDS case in the country. Results of a global clinical trial showed that treating HIV-infected individuals with antiretrovirals - the drug of choice for people with HIV/AIDS - can reduce the risk of sexual transmission of HIV to the uninfected partner by 96%. \"India was a part of this trial. But we should have ideally been a forerunner. In most couples, only one is HIV positive. They always ask if they can have healthy babies without the virus being transmitted to the non-infected person,\" Dr Solomon said. India has been a part of some global research like that of vaccines. So far, India has worked on at least vaccine candidates for HIV/AIDS. The National AIDS Research Institute and the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis have been involved in clinical trails and some private centres have been working on gels that can prevent transmission. \"But the number of international papers coming out of India is less than most developing countries,\" said Dr VD Ramanathan of the National Institute for Tuberculosis Research, who is part of the AIDS vaccine trial. Most researchers said that international funding for HIV/AIDS has declined as the prevalence rate has also relatively dropped. \"It is important to ensure that we stay on a par with global research. That way we will also be able to find solutions for problems specific to our region,\" said Rajat Goyal of International AIDS Vaccine Initiative."}

Many believe that healthy-looking people have a good immune system and may not test positive for HIV/AIDS.

Dr Charles said that in the surveys, people had said cleaning the vagina with vinegar or having sex with monkeys would keep out the infection. The annual survey report, by APAC project along with Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) and USAID, has been prepared since 1996. The survey is conducted among high-risk groups like female sex workers, gays and injecting drug users and bridge population groups such as truckers and migrant workers. With a sample size of 5,000, the field work was done in November and December 2011 across 15 towns in Tamil Nadu. The results showed a significant improvement in the behaviour among targeted groups where NGOs were working. Most field workers had reasons to smile: condom use among female sex workers had gone up from 95.7% to 98.5%; 96.1% of gays reported using condoms during sex with commercial partners, 91% of gays reported taking HIV test in the last one year; the proportion of Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) who reported sharing needles and syringes with their partners reduced from 43.3% in the last round of BSS to 31.6% in the current round; and a lesser number of truckers (28.5%) reported seeking services of commercial sex workers when compared to earlier survey (45.1%). But there is still a need for improvement. For instance, though condom use is high among casual and regular clients, it remains low among regular partners; many counselling services aren\u2019t adequately used; and the changing patterns of sex workers have excluded some women from the intervention programmes."}

Dr Agnes added that the test result was the product of a modern automated system in which samples were fed and results delivered after analysis through a computerized process.

The support group for people with HIV AIDS, including the Delhi Network of Positive People and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res \u2014 an international, independent organization for medical humanitarian aid \u2014 claimed that certain clauses in the deal like \u2018intellectual property enhancements\u2019 and \u2018data exclusivity\u2019 could effectively block the production of generic drugs by Indian companies. \u201cMillions of patients in poor countries, many in Africa, are unable to pay sky-high Western prices to treat illnesses that include HIV, malaria, asthma and cancer.

It will curtail production of many lifesaving drugs, or cause prices to increase to levels many cannot afford, said Menghaney. Kavaljit Singh, director, Madhyam said due to competition among generics producers in India, the price of first-line HIV medicines has dropped by more than 99%, from US$10,000 per person per year in 2000 to roughly $150 presently. \u201cThis significant price decrease has supported the massive expansion of HIV treatment worldwide: more than 80% of the HIV medicines used to treat 6.6 million people in developing countries come from Indian producers, and 90% of pediatric HIV medicines are Indian-produced. MSF and other treatment providers also use Indian generic medicines to treat other diseases and conditions,\u201d he said.

An international team, led by the NYU Langone Medical Center, says its research has in fact revealed a mechanism by which the immune system tries to halt spread of HIV, and harnessing this mechanism may pave the way for therapeutic research aimed at slowing the virus' progression to AIDS. \u201cA lot of research on viruses , especially HIV, is aimed at trying to understand what the body\u2019s mechanisms of resistance are and then to understand how the virus has gotten around these mechanisms,\u201d said team member Nathaniel R Landau in the \u2018Nature Immunology\u2019 journal. The research focused on a protein called SAMHD1. Recent studies have found that immune cells, called dendritic cells, containing the protein are resistant to infection by HIV. But it was not clear till now how it works to protect these cells. Now, Landau and his colleagues are able to provide an answer: When a virus, like HIV, infects a cell, it hijacks the cell\u2019s molecular material to replicate. That molecular material is in the form of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), which are the building blocks for DNA. Once the virus replicates, the resulting DNA molecule contains all the genes of the virus and instructs the cell to make more virus. The team found that SAMHD1 protects the cell from viruses by destroying the pool of dNTPs, leaving the virus without any building blocks to make its genetic information."}

Her four-month-old son in tow, Shaik Haseena pleaded with SHRC authorities for relief saying that after she had tested positive, her husband Nisar Ahmed, a labourer, had abandoned her and the child. Based on her petition, SHRC has asked Ratna Kishore, principal secretary of the medical and heath department and Uma Maheshwar Rao, secretary to the State Red Cross Society, to file reports. Haseena\u2019s family had been instructed by staff at a private hospital in Nellore to arrange for three units of blood which her husband procured from the Red Cross Society. The delivery had to be done via Caesarean section and the blood was requisitioned since Haseena was anaemic. She was discharged a week later with mild fever. When the fever refused to subside even 15 days after she had returned home, her family members took her to the hospital where she underwent tests. The results revealed that she was HIV positive but since blood tests prior to the delivery showed her as HIV negative, doctors said that she might have got infected through the transfusion at the time of delivery. When family members approached the Red Cross Society, officials there denied having sold any blood to them. \u201cShe fed the child for 10 days. Tests are being conducted regularly on her son to know whether he, too, has been infected,\u201d said a relative of Haseena. Although the blood bank was sealed after the incident came to light, Haseena\u2019s travails are far from over. The tiffin centre her mother used to run has gone out of business since customers started staying away after the news of her being HIV positive became public, the relative said. Family members said that despite several requests to Nellore district collector D Sridhar, who is also the chairman of the Red Cross Blood Bank, no financial assistance has been extended nor any treatment arranged for Haseena whose health is deteriorating. However, a plot for a house and provision for the supply of 35 kilos of rice have been made. The SHRC order, issued on Saturday, states that a committee constituted to inquire into the incident has not submitted its report to the collector.

The preliminary data of the 2011 study jointly undertaken by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and AP State Aids Control Society (Apsacs) has revealed that the state witnessed a sharp decline in HIV prevalence among the high risk groups. If the HIV prevalence among female sex workers was 11% in 2008, it has dropped to 7% now. The highest decline was noted among the Men having Sex with Men (MSMs) community wherein from 23%, the incidence plummeted to 10%. Among the Injectable Drug Users (IDUs), the incidence has declined from 7% to 3%. Officials said that the substantial drop in HIV prevalence among female sex workers, which was very high in AP, was an achievement. The state has 1.56 lakh sex workers. Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation alone has 22,000 female sex workers and 4,000 MSMs. Apsacs officials said that the condom usage has increased considerably resulting in the decline of HIV infections. Kailash Aditya, joint director (targeted interventions) said that the health seeking behaviour among the high risk groups has gone up which was earlier not the case. \"This is a very positive sign,\" said Aditya. Officials noted that about two to three years ago, there was a huge scale up of the fatal disease in the state. AP figured among the top five states with highest incidents of HIV. Apsacs subsequently stepped up its interventions going till the grass root level to deal with the high risk groups. Currently, there are 169 targeted interventions in the state. Of these, 23 targeted interventions are being directly implemented by the Community Based Organisations (CBOs). Because of the ownership of the CBOs, the HIV/AIDS prevention services reach a large number of community members, officials said. However, of the 22,000 female sex workers in GHMC jurisdiction, Apsacs has access to just about 16,000 sex workers indicating that better surveillance is required. As far as the state is concerned, the total number of people living with HIV/AIDS is estimated to be over 5 lakh. Of these, 3.75 lakh are registered with Apsacs."}

For more than three months, patients are struggling without treatment as the first line of therapy is not effective to keep the viral load under control. The problem has compounded for patients as the JJ Hospital\u2019s Centre of Excellence remains one of the nodal centres in the state to screen and select patients for second line of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Patients who become resistant to the first line of ART treatment, and have a viral load of more than 5,000 copies per millilitre, have to be started on the second line. Patients are also dependant on the free second line ART treatment as it could cost about Rs 10,000 in a month. A medical source told TOI said the problems started soon after former ART in-charge Dr Alaka Deshpande quit in November 2011. \u201cMonthly meetings, which were held to select patients after their viral load examinations were done, just stopped. Without those meetings the patients could not be selected,\u201d said a JJ Hospital source. Dr BB Rewari, National Aids Control Organization (NACO) ART consultant, said, \u201cThere was no new doctor trained to replace the previous nodal person. The new team headed by Dr V K Joglekar has requested us to sensitize them about the ART. We will be doing that soon.\u201d he said. Rewari also said that not more than 100 patients would be affected because of the delay. \u201cTwo centres in Aurangabad and Pune have commenced operations to take the load off the JJ Hospital staff. Nagpur will also have another centre soon for second line therapy,\u201d he said.

Those who aren\u2019t already infected, however, carry more than 50-times increased risk of getting infected during their lifetime. The region where the risk of HIV infection increased most for a sex worker was Asia (29 times more) compared to a 12-time higher threat in Africa and Latin America. A study, conducted by Dr Stefan Baral from the Center for Public Health and Human Rights at Johns Hopkins\u2019 Bloomberg School of Public Health, to be published by the Lancet on Thursday shows that FSWs in developing countries are 14 times more likely to be infected by HIV than women in the general population. The authors carried out an analysis of 102 studies, representing almost 100,000 FSWs in 50 countries. Overall, HIV prevalence in FSWs was found to be 12%. In 26 countries deemed to have medium or high background HIV prevalence, some 31% of FSWs were HIV- positive, and were 12 times more likely to be infected than women from the general population. \u201cWe identified consistent evidence of substantially higher levels of HIV among FSWs compared with all women of reproductive age in low and middle-income countries in all regions with data,\u201d the authors said. \u201cThese findings suggest an urgent need to scale up access to quality HIV-prevention programming and services among FSWs because of their heightened burden of disease and likelihood of onward transmission through high numbers of sexual partners as clients. Improvement of linkages to antiretroviral treatment and retention in care is crucial. The role of stigma, discrimination and violence targeting female sex workers globally will be required to reduce the disproportionate disease burden among these women,\u201d they added. \u201cWhen reviewing the data from the past five years, FSWs still carry more than a 50-time increased odds of HIV infection in India. Since HIV prevalence is a lagging indicator of prevention success, time is needed to reveal the benefit of these programmes in terms of the absolute burden of HIV among female sex workers in India. Nonetheless, the disproportionate burden of HIV among these sex workers, even in settings where progressive programmes exist, emphasizes the need to increase coverage by increasing scale of prevention programmes and decreasing barriers to access,\u201d is how The Lancet summed about the situation in India. In India, women account for around one million out of 2.5 million estimated number of people living with HIV/AIDS. The National Aids Control Organization estimates that around 4.9% of FSWs in India are HIV- positive. The estimated number of new annual HIV infections has declined by more than 50% over the past decade. India had about 1.2 lakh new HIV infections in 2009 as against 2.7 lakh in 2000. While this trend is evident in most states, some low prevalence states have shown an increase in the number of new infections over the past two years. Of the 1.2 lakh estimated new infections in 2009, the six high-prevalence states account for only 39% of the cases, while states like Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat account for 41% of new infections. The adult HIV prevalence at national level has continued its steady decline from estimated level of 0.41% in 2000 through 0.36% in 2006 to 0.31% in 2009. In India, about 40% people don\u2019t even know their HIV status. The prevalence of HIV among key population at higher risk of infection \u2013 notably sex workers, people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men \u2013 is high in several Asian countries. However, the virus is spreading to other sections of the population through the years."}

The Commission's steering committee on health for the 12th five-year Plan has proposed \"incorporating AIDS control, universal healthcare and universal access to essential medicines\" into NRHM. Planning Commission member in-charge of health Syeda Hameed said, \"It is a serious recommendation to incorporate NACO under an overall National Health Mission rather that a single vertical programme.\" The proposal, however, has left both the Union health ministry and the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) unhappy. Union health secretary P K Pradhan said, \"We have told the Planning Commission that this recommendation cannot work. AIDS control is a specialized issue, and needs focused attention.\" Pradhan added that AIDS control cannot be carried out by Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs). \"Containing AIDS and HIV in India will require dealing with sex workers, injectible drug users, transgenders and men who have sex with men. It is a different clientele compared to the work that ANMs do now. We are not in favour of the merger,\" Pradhan added. Hameed, however, disagrees. She argued, \"It's all about training the ANMs on how to carry out AIDS control. We, however, don't want to burden them too much. The steering committee report will undergo three levels of approval. We are confident of pushing it through.\" The steering committee report says \"Impressive gains made by national health programs, including NRHM and other disease control programs, now need to be channeled to deliver Universal Healthcare in all urban and rural areas during the 12th Plan period.\" It adds, \"The process should start during the first year of the plan itself with Universal Healthcare pilots being run in one district of each state and UT. Concurrently, the management structure of national health programmes needs to take steps to prepare for UHC. Key recommendations on this transition is reorienting from vertical disease based approach to a holistic, health promotion strategy based on strengthening of health systems.\" The panel says the B K Chaturvedi Committee on Restructuring of Centrally Sponsored Schemes has also recommended merger of individual disease control programmes. \"The NRHM governance structure should be used to provide leadership to all the national health programmes. Operations under national disease control programmes should be harmonized under NRHM so as to avoid duplication and provide convergent services in a cost-effective manner,\" the report says. India launched the first National AIDS Control Programme (NACP I) in 1992, while NACP II was initiated 1998. NACP III (2007-2012) was designed with the prime objective to \"halt and reverse the HIV epidemic in India\" by the end of the project. There has been a steady decline in overall prevalence, and nearly 50% dip in new infections over the last 10 years. Most of NACP III was funded by external partners like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with domestic budgetary support to the department of AIDS control being less than 5% of the department's budget. The estimated number of new annual HIV infections has declined by more than 50% over the past decade. It is estimated that India had approximately 1.2 lakh new HIV infections in 2009 as against 2.7 lakh in 2000. Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat account for 41% of new infections.

This was revealed in a field survey of 401 such families in the city, undertaken by the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics (GIPE) to gauge the economic profile of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) and the socio-economic impact of HIV at the household level. The families surveyed are registered with a city NGO, which works towards providing socio-psycho, legal support and counselling to PLHIV. Though the study included households from all strata of society, and from varied economic backgrounds, nearly 50% of the sample group was from the lower economic categories. The study was completed under the guidance of Sanjeevanee Mulay, former associate professor at GIPE. Varun Sharma, who undertook the study, is a former senior research fellow at GIPE and currently assistant professor at the Institute of Health Management Research (IHMR) in Bangalore. He said the study was an attempt to estimate the relationship between HIV prevalence and poverty. \u201cWe cannot overlook the fact that PLHIV from the lower socio-economic background, especially from the slum areas in cities like Pune, are most vulnerable. This should be considered while drafting policies and programmes concerning HIV,\u201d he said. Sharma said the study used economic methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Standard of Living Index (SLI). Based on these two indices, the study found that families with HIV+ persons are more destitute compared to other families. \u201cThis is especially true of households run by HIV+ women. The study revealed that 70% of the sample households managed by women have a middle socio-economic status whereas about 50% of them can be categorised as the \u2018poorest of the poor\u2019. In comparison, only 30% of households run by men fit in the category. The reason for this may be that, in general, a woman\u2019s income is less than that of a man,\u201d he said. The study revealed that though anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for treating HIV is free at the public health centres, HIV+ people have to spend from their own pockets on other illnesses and ailments which come with the HIV infection, Sharma said. \u201cThe economic burden is more on those who are already poor, and it leads to medical poverty trap. In the analysis, we found that there is a sharp increase of 20% BPL headcounts, when adjusted for out-of-pocket health spending,\u201d he said. HIV+ people from the upper and middle socio-economic backgrounds usually opt for private health facilities, which are better, and also because it offers them a privacy. Sharma said a comparison between the families surveyed and the city\u2019s non-HIV urban households (surveyed under the national reproductive and child health programme) confirmed that a majority of PLHIV households either came from the lower economic strata of society or had gradually become impoverished over a period of time. According to the study, 36.9% households with HIV+ members had a low standard of living. Sanjeevani Kulkarni, coordinator, Prayas Health Group, which treats more than 3,500 HIV/AIDS patients from the city and other parts of the country at its clinic, said special focus on widowed women diagnosed with HIV is needed. \u201cAround 33% of the total population of HIV infected women belongs to this category. Implementation of policies that address the needs of such sections of society is imperative,\u201d she said."}

Hailing the administration's effort to take care of the HIV infected children's, social activists said the children should be brought up with the involvement of their respective communities. \"The decision to set up a hostel for the HIV infected children is a welcome move as there is no scheme to rehabilitate an orphaned HIV child in the district.

An AIDS patient cannot be denied employment or sacked except with a written assessment of an independent healthcare provider that the person poses a risk of transmission of virus to others at the workplace. These are some of the path-breaking provisions in a law drafted by the government that provides for stiff punishment for discrimination against those who are HIV-positive and for propagating hatred against the victims of the infection. The \u2018new deal\u2019 for a stigmatized group that is often condemned twice is in the final stage of approval with the Centre finalizing the long-pending HIV-AIDS (Prevention & Control) Bill that was caught in differences between ministries of law and health. It lays down inviolable rights for patients and stringent duties for individuals and institutions dealing with them. HIV test not must for getting jobs, proposes bill The proposed law states that testing for AIDS cannot be a pre-requisite for employment or for access to healthcare, education or public places. It would mean that HIV afflicted people refused entry to public places like hotels or restaurants or denied purchase or renting of house can move an ombudsman. They can also move courts against discrimination. Also, a person with HIV virus cannot be sacked or denied employment except with a written assessment of a qualified and independent healthcare provider that the afflicted person indeed poses risks of transmission. Any person below 18 years of age and a woman of any age will have the right to live in a shared property, as a safeguard against eviction due to stigma. The medical costs will be factored in during any maintenance settlements. This can help women in divorce cases. The law would put in place a National Authority in the form of a Department of AIDS Control (NACO), which will formulate guidelines and rules for protocols like treatment of HIV patients through Anti-Retroviral Therapy or rules for blood banks or diagnostic centres. An ombudsman in every state, as the forum to adjudicate violations under the law, would help the aggrieved to avoid time-consuming legal proceedings in civil courts. The law seeks to deter rampant victimization of HIV-positive persons. A key clause prescribes a jail term of three months to two years for any spoken or written word, or display of information or advertisement, which could expose HIV-positive persons to any form of hostility. This can also lead to a fine up to Rs one lakh. The inviolable right of an HIV person, as part of the first-ever codification of rights and duties, may help patients who face subtle or overt discrimination with no forum for grievance redressal. The law asserts no person can be forced to take an HIV test. For such a test, the authority would have to secure consent after due counseling on all pros and cons. Similarly, no HIV-positive person can be subjected to medical treatment without his consent \u2013 a decision which should be made after he has been informed about the risks and benefits of the treatment. A judicial order would be the only exception to force an AIDS test on a person apart from \u201cscreening purpose\u201d in a blood bank. The HIV positive persons would finally enjoy guaranteed confidentiality. No person can be compelled to disclose his HIV status (except under a court directive). In a strict deterrent, the law states that if a person reveals the identity of an HIV-positive, as information that is passed on as part of legal proceedings, he could face a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh. To balance the threat of transmission with stringent non-disclosure law, a doctor can disclose his patient\u2019s HIV-positive status to his partner if he believes there is a risk of infection. However, he would have to guard against such disclosure about a woman if there is apprehension that it can lead to her being abandoned or facing violence. The ombudsman can impose an initial fine of Rs 10,000, and thereafter Rs 5,000 a day for non-compliance of orders. To ensure that non-discrimination clause of Act is followed at workplace, every institution with over 100 employees would have to appoint a senior officer to deal with violations of the law."}

RNP+ state in-charge, projects, John Samuel said, \"The project will help in establishing effective links between various service delivery points and proper support to beneficiaries for availing facilities of all components including: (i) nutritional support through Integrated Child Development Scheme; (ii) Free diagnosis, medicine and treatment for all ailments including ARVs (Antiretroviral), (iii) Promote and ensure institutional delivery for pregnant women from initial stage of ANC services to Janani Shishu Suraksha Yojana, (iv) Awareness generation on available vocational training centres (v) Provision for financial support like pension, insurance or social security; (vi) Priority in other schemes available for women and people living below poverty line (e.g., Anthodaya, free housing, access to land, etc.) and (vii) Free legal aid in case of any disputes.\" He said that the project will be focused on WLHIVs and CLHIVs as the coordinators and facilitators would be only women. It will also groom WLHIV as responsible care givers with increased knowledge and best practices to support themselves and their families. This will help reduce stigma-related practices, make services more inclusive, support the existing government mechanism to perform well. The RNP+ claimed that the project is mainly focusing on optimum use of the knowledge and skills of already trained care givers in HIV infected and affected households to further carry out effective outreach activities for the benefit of CLHIV (Children Living with HIV AIDS) in particular and WLHIV and families in general."}

The BU has no objection, if the agencies install a machine on the campus.\" \"We all know it is not possible to cure the AIDS. It can only be prevented.

But my child is about to bloom. After all relatives having washed their hands of her care, I don't know how she will live and who will power her dreams and shape her future.\" The state of children living with HIV/AIDS (CLHA) is growing grim, with more than 400 such children waiting for someone to make their lives a bit easier. Ragini is passionate about dancing and whenever the song 'Ata jau dya na ghari' is played, her legs just begin to tap and she loses herself in the music. \"I go to school at Nashik Road. I don't remember my mother, who died when I was one. My father died when I was nine. I know I have the disease, but also know that I can fight it,\" said Ragini. Similar is the fate of 12-year-old visually impaired CLHA, Ankush, who lives in a slum in Satpur. Ankush loves to play the keyboard and other instruments. He lost his father three years back to AIDS and his mother Sangeeta, also HIV positive, is terminally ill. Sangeeta hopes that the government will raise some shelter system for such children. \"Having acquired AIDS from their spouse, women are the worst hit. They lose their husband, their own life and also are unable to see their kids living happily. At least if there is an arrangement for the well-being of the kids, we can be at peace,\" Sangeeta said. The government, on its own part, cannot allow any such facility, as this would mean discriminating against the ill-fated children, who are the victims in this whole vicious circle. \"The government has no scheme to promote a separate facility for HIV positive persons as it would amount to discrimination,\" said a senior official from the health department, adding that instead, the government was ready to fund all the medical aid required by the patients. But such means are found insufficient when it comes to the lives of CLHA, once their parents or grandparents pass away. Mahindra and Mahindra along with Yash Foundation has started an HIV/AIDS awareness programme and is working on the rehabilitation of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) and support to CLHAs. \"For the last three years, we have been providing nutritional support to more than 150 CLHAs, monitoring their health and even giving them medical support whenever required. But unfortunately, we do not have a residential system for the children,\" said Jitendra Patil, rehabilitation manager, Yash Foundation. This is the time when the need of such arrangement is required the most. In the field of medical inventions, medicos have found solutions such that even HIV-positive parents can give birth to a normal child. \"The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) could serve the purpose by raising an 'educational hostel' facility for the short span of twenty years from today. Here, even normal children could also be admitted. The children could go home during the weekends,\" Patil suggested. Exhibition with a cause Mahindra and Mahindra, along with Yash Foundation is trying to raise funds to help reach more number of CLHAs in the district. In one such drive, they had organized a 'Taarein Zameen Par' programme on January 26, where renowned artists Shivaji Tupe, Anand Sonar and Dnyanesh Belekar from Nashik, with students from the Arts stream created a large number of paintings, which have now been put for auction from April 30 to May 2 at Sadhana Art Gallery, Deepali Nagar, from 11am to 8pm. \"We aim to raise funds for the CLHAs in such a way that we reach the most number of CLHAs in the district,\" Patil said.

While 1,091 men succumbed to AIDS, the health problem resulted in the end of life for 379 women and 47 children. To a query under the Right to Information Act, the KSACS revealed that 19,905 persons were tested positive for HIV infection during this period. A total of 3,700 men were diagnosed with AIDS in this period, and the number of women and children who were affected was 2,354 and 320 respectively. The highest number of positive cases was reported in Thiruvananthapuram - 4,034: 2,126 men, 1,489 women and 219 children. Thrissur came second with 3,426 cases: 1,865 men, 1,376 women and 185 children, while Kozhikode reported 2,953 cases: 1,694 men, 1,097 women and 162 children.

According to the data of 2011, 61 children were found to be positive, with 12 each in Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur and 10 in Kozhikode. The rate of infection is coming down in the state even though more cases are being detected because of the awareness among the public. \"Based on our research, Kerala has an estimated 40,000 HIV cases, but we have only identified 19,000-odd cases, so the other cases are lying hidden. Our effort is to bring out these people. We have brought out many campaigns for it, and that is how there is an increase in the number of reported cases,\" says Dr K Shylaja, project director of KSACS. What alarms the authorities is the rise in the number of cases among the young generation. Unlike in the past, the high-risk group's definition has changed. Instead of sex workers and truck drivers, youths seem to carry the infection the most nowadays. \"Casual relations and a tendency to adopt Western culture in general could be the reasons for this increase in cases among youths. We are targeting them with our campaigns and educational programmes, \"said Dr K Shylaja. But not many agree with the statistics provided by the KSACS. According to agencies working in this sector, new cases are being reported from across the state now. \"Many teenagers are coming to ART centres now, and their cases can't be as old as the officials claim them to be.

The rise in condom usage has brought down the HIV prevalence in the state significantly among its high risk group population. The 7.5 crore free condoms that were supplied for the high risk groups got exhausted much before the end of the year and the state had to request the Tamil Nadu government to donate their leftover 60 lakh condoms in March. Seeing the massive response, the National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) has added to AP\u2019s quota of condoms and will now ship 10.9 crore condoms this year. The authorities are attributing the substantial drop in the HIV prevalence rate to the increased condom usage. As per the survey conducted by AP State Aids Control Society (Apsacs) and Naco, that is being finalized, the HIV prevalence among female sex workers has dropped from 11% in 2008 to 7% now. The highest decline was noted among the Men having Sex with Men (MSMs) community wherein from 23%, the incidence plummeted to 10%. Among the Injectable Drug Users (IDUs), the incidence has declined from 7% to 3%. The sexually transmitted infections too have seen a drastic drop. Officials say that till about four years ago, the situation was so dismal that lakhs of condoms were wasted, having crossed their expiry dates because of no takers. But today, Apsacs is struggling to ensure that shortages don\u2019t crop up. \u201cPeople have become more health conscious now and they are also seeking the services of the integrated counseling and testing centres. This is a healthy trend,\u201d says T Kailashditya, joint director, targeting interventions, Apsacs. He added that Uttar Pradesh tops the country in condom usage and is followed by West Bengal, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Apsacs has been selling condoms at a subsidized rate to several sections such as truckers. Last year, 1.5 crore condoms were marketed like this for this population apart from the 7.5 crore free condoms doled out to the high risk groups. \u201cThe situation is such that we have to plan a month in advance for the supply to avoid a shortage,\u201d said the official. Besides, condoms are being lapped up over the counters by the general population. Experts said that factors such as education, benefits of condom use and perceived infection risk are also playing an important role. They added that after five years of effort, the demand for condoms has gone up and the HIV prevalence rate has shown a decline. However, the state still has the highest number of people (5 lakh) living with HIV/AIDS in the country."}

Speaking as chief guest on the International AIDS Candlelight Memorial observation here on Sunday, he lauded the role played by HIV positive people and drug users in leading the struggle for protection of rights and decreasing the spread of the HIV epidemic. Manipur is one of the six states in the country with widespread prevalence of HIV/AIDS. According to the Manipur Aids Control Society (MACS), the state has 38,573 HIV positive people and 698 have died of the disease till March 2011. Till May 2001, 19,455 people have registered for Anti Retroviral Therapy. Drawing the attention of the MACS project director to the unfinished task of revising the state AIDS policy, legislator I Ibohanbi Singh said policies are a must for tackling issues like HIV and AIDS. \"The draft state AIDS policy needs to be tabled at the earliest and discussed threadbare so that our response to the epidemic is in tune with the needs of the community. We need commitment and the gap between NGOs implementing HIV-related programmes and MACS has to be bridged so that the need of vulnerable communities are addressed,\" he said. MACS project director Sailesh Kumar Chourasia said the event, based on the theme 'Promoting Health and Dignity Together', gave the people an opportunity to look at what they have achieved so far and, more importantly, chart out a future course of action to sustain the effort. Different departments need to come together if we want to respond to the epidemic in a holistic manner, he said. Sixteen civil society organizations, human rights groups, lawyers, drug users, nupi manbi (transgenders) and positive networks and NGOs in the state joined the observation. The memorial function kicked off on Saturday with a painting competition for children affected by HIV and AIDS. It will continue as a year-long state-level campaign for solidarity in fighting the epidemic."}

Many memories are bitter, after being shunned by the society for a long time. Their future looks bright, after tasting their first success, sweeter because they\u2019ve fought the dreaded HIV. It\u2019s been a lonely fight, with hardly any family support and campuses unaware of their disease and only an NGO to keep up their morale. This result season, TOI is showcasing not only toppers but also students who may not have scored extraordinary marks but deserve their place in the sun. This group is one such, making education inclusive in its truest sense. Like Jacob who secured 83.5%. An adopted child, he ran away from home after his stepmother\u2019s death because people around him had no empathy for him. He\u2019s a Kannada-medium student and stammers when he speaks in English.

In a unique initiative, the state government has proposed monthly financial assistance of Rs 1,000 for patients suffering from the disease. While orphaned children infected with HIV/AIDS will get Rs 2,050 per month, other children will get Rs 1,750 per month. The budget has earmarked an initial corpus of Rs 5 crore for the ambitious health scheme. This scheme was among the key highlights of Delhi government's budget for 2012-13 in the health sector, for which Rs 2,124 crore (14.16% of the total outlay) has been allocated. State health minister AK Walia told TOI that more than 300 beneficiaries have already been identified for the issuance of the assistance money. \"There are about 10,000 HIV/AIDS patients registered with us for anti-retroviral treatment. These patients need extra nutrition and balanced diet to cope with their compromised immune system. The financial aid is aimed at helping such patients,\" said Walia. In a relief for thalassaemia patients, the government will introduce VAT exemption on 'blood bags' (lucocite filters), which will reduce the cost of blood storage and transfusion. The introduction of improved immunisation cover for children with pentavalent vaccine, which is administered for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B and haemophilus influenza type B, was also announced in the budget. Expansion of the ambulance fleet, increasing the number of dialysis machines at hospitals and improving the infrastructure at Delhi State Cancer Institute were among other highlights. However, the budget proposals for the health sector, pertaining to development of health infrastructure, can largely be described as old wine in new bottle. It proposes to increase the number of hospital beds per thousand population in the capital from 2.55 (beds per thousand population) at present to three (beds per thousand population). For this, the government has said new hospitals will be constructed at Burari, Ambedkar Nagar, Hastsal and Sarita Vihar, among other places - most of these projects were mentioned in last year's budget also."}

This has come to light with the proper functioning of government's HIV test centre in the district. Although the rise in number of HIV cases is a matter of concern for the common man, the district health department is looking at it in a positive manner. \"This will not only help the HIV positive person to avail better and free treatment but also stop transmission of HIV to others,\" said an official. In last two years the official figure of HIV positive cases was put at 22. Till 2010, eleven persons, including pregnant women and children, were found to be HIV positive in the tests conducted at the government's Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) run by State AIDS Control Society. Year-wise detection of HIV positive cases in the district for last three years on an average stands at five. The ICTC was opened in Lohardaga in 2008. Only one one HIV positive case was detected that year. Later detection of HIV positive cases increased. While in 2009 three such cases were detected. The number increased to seven in 2010, five were detected in 2011 and sixes cases have been detected so far in 2012, thereby, taking the total number since 2008 to 22. ICTC counsellor Archna Prasad, however, is not satisfied with the number of detection of HIV positive cases in the district. According to Prasad, many more persons suffer the disease but hesitate to come to the ICTC located at the Lohardaga Sadar Hospital for tests and counseling. \"Since my centre maintains everything one needs, trust is necessary. Although people are coming for HIV tests, we still have miles to go with regard to bringing about awareness among the people and removing reservation of those affected by HIV but keeping away from the ICTC. Migration is the source of the disease and this is a major problem as it is difficult to counsel, conduct tests and offer treatment to the affected persons who live outside the state. At most times we ask relatives to encourage their family members to go for testing at their nearest ICTC where they live,\" Prasad said. The absence of anti retro-viral therapy (ART) centre in the district is creating a problem. A 32-year-old woman found with HIV positive recently has still not started medication as she cannot travel alone. \"She is waiting for her husband, who works in Mumbai, to return.

Women living with HIV/AIDS may also get priority at government shelter homes. This is among the measures being proposed by women and child development (WCD) department of the government of India. Vandana Jena, adviser to the WCD in planning commission shared this information after a formal launch of country's second Women Resource Centre (WRC) in city at India Peace Centre. The centre has been set up with the help of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). First WRC was set up at Ajmer. Jena said that every district may have one such shelter home. Women with no shelter like destitute women, Dalit women, and widows can seek shelter here through a national helpline to be created for the purpose. Priority will also be given to HIV-positive women in these homes. In fact, government is also contemplating support for 'women in conflict areas' like those affected by left extremists. WRCs are aimed at linking all the different government welfare schemes to the women and children living with HIV/AIDS. The Positive Women Network (PWN), an NGO working for HIV-positive women in country in 13 states at present, is the force behind the centre. The funds for the centre come from UNDP. These women generally become widows at a very early age. Since they are afraid of disclosing their HIV status openly, they cannot avail the benefits of various social welfare projects and schemes. WRC will work for bringing these schemes to the positive women by helping them with documentation and follow up procedures to get the benefits faster. Umesh Chawla from UNDP said that problems of women living with HIV/AIDS were compounding. WRC would act as a link between the social protection schemes of the government and affected women. Akhila Sivadas from the Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR) lauded the efforts of the pioneer of such women's cause, P Kousalya, president of PWN which has helped about 28,000 women so for in various ways. She said that Kousalya is the living testimony of the struggle such women undergo. \"The dynamics of government working do not allow people to champion the cause of such women. But Kousalya has proved it otherwise with her dedication, sincerity and above all her daring to face the highest officials in planning commission and seek intervention for PWN members,\" she said.

In fact, she was the first HIV-positive woman to admit her status before the media. P Kousalya, now president of the Positive Women Network (PWN), became a widow at the age of 19 after just seven months of marriage. Instead of losing heart, she championed the cause of women like her. Kousalya shared her journey from her initial plight of not getting the right treatment and drugs to her present achievement of seeing her dream of starting Women Resource Centres (WRCs) for women and children living with HIV/AIDS with TOI on the sidelines of the launch of the centre in city. \"My mother had decided to marry me to my husband when both of us were child. He was a truck driver and knew he was infected with HIV just a few days before our marriage. He did not share it with me and passed the infection to me. Although I studied till Standard XII, I didn't know anything about the disease. I even went to quacks,\" said Kousalya describing her journey from Namakkal, a town in Tamil Nadu infamous for high HIV/AIDS prevalence. Looking back, she says she realized what good her family did to her and society at large by letting her share her HIV status. It was a blessing in disguise for women like me. \"Now I can stand face to face with authorities and demand our rights. Initially, I had to face a lot of hardship as I was thrown out of such platforms. But now I am a part of not just national but also international forums working for the cause.

Koraput holds the second highest position in the state in terms of AIDS mortality with over 10 deaths and more than 1000 affected. Most tribal youngsters have little or no idea about AIDS. This is a golden opportunity for them to get to know everything about the disease. \"After coming here, I realized I was quite ignorant about several facts regarding HIV/AIDS and its precautionary measures. I used to feel shy about asking my elders or friends about the disease. But now all my doubts have been cleared,\" said Subha Pangi of Pottangi. The six-coach multimedia, multi-facility train has arrangements for pictorial, audio-visual, graphic and even telephonic presentation on HIV/AIDS. It drew a large crowd from the tribal district on the very first day of its arrival. Koraput is the train's first stop in the state, and it will stay here till Thursday. tnnVolunteers from several social organizations gathered here to know more about the deadly disease. \"The RRE has proved to be beneficial for the tribals of the district, who are mostly illiterate and ignorant about the disease. Most of the rural folk are in the dark about this deadly disease and fall prey to it unknowingly. This was a good experience for them,\" said a local social activist, K Rama Rao. The RRE, which was flagged off in the second week of January from New Delhi as a part of a HIV/ AIDS awareness campaign, will camp at Balangir, Bargarh, Samablpur, Angul, Cuttack and Ganjam before reching Bhubaneswar on July 10. While the first coach displays bio-medical aspects of the disease, counselling-cum-medical services are available in the last coach. Three other coaches are dedicated to exhibitions on the disease. A fourth coach exhibits details on tuberculosis, malaria, reproductive and child health services, general health and hygiene. Going beyond the usual posters and pictures, the coaches have touch screens and 3-D models to disseminate information. Prior to the inauguration of the RRE at the Koraput railway station by collector Koraput Sachin Jadhav, an awareness rally against the disease was organized in the town."}

This humble bacteria \u2014 known as Psychrophile \u2014 holds the potential to solve India\u2019s sanitation problem in the years to come. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is using these bacteria for the bio-digester technology it developed for disposal of human waste in an eco-friendly manner. DRDO has already tied up with the Indian Railways for bio-toilets on trains. On Sunday, the technology will be inaugurated on Sunday at Dhamra in Odisha in the presence of Jairam Ramesh, Union minister of rural development, drinking water and sanitation.?It was Ramesh\u2019s caustic remark in May that got the DRDO involved in installing the odourless bio-toilets that it had developed in rural areas. The minister had rued the fact that while India is capable of launching inter continental ballistic missiles like Agni and satellites, women still don\u2019t have access to proper sanitation. According to him, 60% of women in the country do not have access to toilets. Immediately after this, DRDO took it upon itself to take up rural sanitation as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility. The location chosen was Dhamra, which is close to the spot from where the Agni-V missile was successfully test-fired recently. The toilets developed by DRDO were originally meant for harsh climates. They can function at temperatures ranging from -55 degree Celsius to 60 degree Celsius. DRDO scientists brought the bacteria from Antarctica and started to develop them to suit Indian standards. This bacteria breaks down human waste and produces colourless and odourless inflammable bio gas that comprises 50-70% methane. \"There is a bio-digester underneath where the temperature is maintained at 5-30 degree Celsius. The bacteria break down the waste. There is no foul smell, disease-carrying organisms or solid matter. Nearly 90% of the solid waste is reduced. The bio-gas is released into the air continuously and can be used for cooking and heating. The residual liquid can be drained without any ill-effect,\" a scientist said. The Army has already set up these toilets in Siachen and other high-altitude regions and also in bases in the desert . The plan is to cover at least 1,000 Gram Panchayats across the country with this technology soon. The toilets are extremely easy to set up and scientists assure that the bacteria will be soon available in packets and pouches. By the end of this year, at least some of some trains in the country will have the bio-degradable toilets on a pilot basis."}

Talking about the recent approval by the NACO, Dr Vanita Gupta, project director State Aids Control Society (SACS) said, \"Earlier this group of high risk in the city was refused as it was not included in the long distance driving. However, it has been now included in the NACO's mapping.

There are 12 target intervention groups which are high risk for HIV. \"In the migrants category we had labourers only. But from next month we will start headcount of truck drivers who can be at risk. This particular group has been recognized as the most vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases all across the country,\" said Dr Gupta. There has bee no survey till now on the truck drivers. \"Transport chowk area is the hub of such migrants who commute on regular basis to the adjoining states. This migrant category needs sensitization which can now be possible,\" said Sandeep Mittal, who will manage this project. For the overall reduction in the epidemic, targeted interventions are aimed to effect behaviour change through raising awareness among the high risk groups. It has been researched that truckers are a critical group. Their living and working conditions, sexually active age and separation from regular partners for extended periods of time predispose them to paid sex or sex with non-regular partners. \"These interventions build awareness among the spouses of truckers and migrant workers, women aged 15 to 49 and children affected by HIV or vulnerable population groups,\" said Dr Gupta."}

CBI probe has been ordered for the first time by the HC while acting on a PIL. When the kids were found infected with HIV last year, parents and lawyers from the HC filed PIL demanding a thorough probe. The state government did not even register an FIR against erring officials. The court asked IPS officer Shobha Bhutada to probe the case, but the judges expressed disappointment at her efforts. Transferring the probe to the CBI, the bench of acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattachayra and Justice J B Pardiwala criticized Bhutada's probe and highlighted her inaction and blunders in its judgment. The judges were shocked at Bhutada's recording statement of local BJP MLA Mahendra Mashroo on the letterhead of a private blood bank, Sarvodaya Blood Bank, which faces charge of being criminally negligent in blood transfusion. Emphasizing on inaction on part of the IPS officer, the court noted that allegations were against high level officers and the legislator, who illegally occupied space in the government hospital and he being chairman of the blood bank invaded into government's official site and all top officials were blissfully ignorant about this. The court said that the administration saw to it that probe did not take place in proper manner, as the government was even reluctant to register an FIR. The court observed that no effective steps were taken during five months of probe and the system seemed supporting the private blood bank, which did not even have a license. \"In our view, the present case is an exceptional one where in the history of this country, at no point of time in the past, 23 innocent children have been alleged to be infected with HIV positive for the inaction or negligence on the part of a single government hospital and in such extraordinary circumstances, we are of the opinion, we should transfer the probe to the CBI,\" the court order read. The court said that handing over the probe to an independent agency could instill confidence among people in circumstances, wherein inaction is apparent. The court rejected all contentions raised by the state government. Certain lame arguments were also put forth by the government that the CBI officials might have problem in going through documents in Gujarati. To this, the judges wrote, \"We will definitely pass appropriate order for removing the difficulty in lawful way for the purpose of finding out the real culprit; otherwise, there will be no fair investigation and in future also, other innocent persons will be the victims of negligence.\""}

The findings of two large international randomized trials to be published on Friday's Lancet says the new \"Quad\" pill is faster acting, doesn't have the neuropsychiatric side-effects associated with other combinations, and could improve compliance with treatment. Patient adherence to medication is vital, especially for patients with HIV, where missed doses can quickly lead to the virus becoming resistant to medication. Older HIV treatment regimens involve taking several pills multiple times a day. Paul Sax from Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, lead author of the first study, said, \"Our results provide an additional highly potent, well-tolerated treatment option and highlight the simplicity of treatment resulting from combining several antiretrovirals in a single pill.\" Sax said studies have shown that single pill treatments improve both adherence and patient satisfaction and help prevent prescription errors, helping reducing the likelihood of treatment failure and drug resistance. The first trial randomly assigned 700 patients from centres across North America to start treatment with two different single tablet regimens \u2014 either Quad, combining the new integrase inhibitor elvitegravir (EVG) boosted with cobicistat (a new pharmacoenhancer COBI) plus FTC/TDF, or a gold standard regimen approved by the FDA in 2006, combining EFV/FTC/TDF (also known as Atripla). After 48 weeks of treatment, 88% of patients given Quad suppressed viral loads to undetectable levels (less than 50 copies per mL of blood), compared with 84% in the EFV/FTC/TDF group. Adverse events that led to patients discontinuing treatment were infrequent and similar in both groups. Mild nausea was more common with Quad, but patients were less likely to have dizziness, abnormal dreams, insomnia, and rash compared with the EFV/FTC/TDF regimen. The second trial included 708 treatment-na\u00efve adults from 146 medical centres across Australia, Europe, North America and Thailand. Patients were randomly assigned to receive once-daily Quad or a popular and recommended twice-daily combination of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/RTV) plus FTC/TDF. The primary endpoint, to achieve viral levels below 50 copies per mL of blood by week 48, was reached by 90% of people in the Quad group compared with 87% in the ATV/RTV/FTC/TDF group. The safety of the two regimens was also similar with only 3.7% of patients stopping treatment in the Quad group and 5.1% of patients in the ATV/RTV/FTC/TDF group. If approved by regulatory agencies, the Quad would be the first once-daily single-tablet regimen containing an HIV integrase inhibitor. Administration of multiple pills and management of additional prescriptions increases complexity, costs for patients, and the chances of poor or partial adherence. For regimens of the same efficacy, total pill burden and dosing frequency are some of the most significant obstacles to achieving high adherence. \"The EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF single-tablet regimen is undergoing regulatory review; if approved, it would provide an important new treatment option as the only once-daily, integrase-inhibitor-based, single-tablet regimen for initial treatment of patients with HIV,\" the study added."}

Apac was administered by Voluntary Health Services, a non-profit hospital in Taramani, with funds from USAID.

In the last 17 years, they, together, brought out several studies on prevalence of HIV/AIDS, behavioural pattern of people in high-risk groups and planned several strategies for prevention and rehabilitation of the disease among sex workers, truckers and drug users. They also planned programmes for care and support of those with HIV/AIDS. \u201cWe worked on many projects together and at one point the line between Tansacs and Apac was almost invisible. With scientific models and technical support, Apac not only brought in valuable programme but also brought in systems,\u201d she said. For the first time, the government shared even the most uncomfortable data every survey and research it did on HIV/AIDS. Apac officials said they would continue to support the state health system projects in areas such as bio-medical waste management, equipment maintenance and help government develop communication research and data resource centers. Dr Lakshmibai, who joined Apac as a research officer, said the end of the programme did not mean end of need. \u201cWe managed to bring down the incidence but we will have to sustain awareness and prevention programmes for a few more years,\u201d she said.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Wednesday approved the first over-the-counter HIV test kit that allows people to test at home to see whether they are infected with the virus that causes AIDS. The OraQuick In-Home HIV test is designed to allow individuals to collect an oral fluid sample by swabbing the upper and lower gums inside of their mouths, then place that sample into a developer vial and obtain test results within 20-40 minutes. However, a positive result with this test does not mean that an individual is definitely infected with HIV, but rather that additional testing should be done in a medical setting to confirm the result. Similarly, a negative test result does not mean that an individual is definitely not infected with HIV, particularly when exposure may have been within the previous three months. FDA says the test has the potential to identify large numbers of previously undiagnosed HIV infections, especially if used by those unlikely to use standard screening methods. \u201cKnowing your status is an important factor in the effort to prevent the spread of HIV,\u201d said Karen Midthun, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. \u201cThe availability of a home-use HIV test kit provides another option for individuals to get tested so that they can seek medical care, if appropriate.\u201d However, India is not going to allow home testing of this deadly infection. India\u2019s National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) told TOI that counseling patients before and after they undergo testing is vital. \u201cIf patients find themselves HIV positive by testing at home without counseling, it can push them to suffer from severe depression, make them commit suicide or lead to violence if women are found to be positive. Around 35% of all new cases of HIV in India are among women India. Such home testing kits can be allowed in countries with high infection rates in the general population and not in India where the epidemic is concentrated among high risk populations like sex workers,\u201d said national ART officer at NACO Dr B B Rewari. Union health ministry officials said at present nearly 10,000 centres across India counsel people who undertake a HIV test. In 2011, an estimated 1.6 million people got tested for HIV. Around 2.31 million people are estimated to be HIV positive in India. \u201cOf these, 40% don\u2019t know that they are infected. Counseling is vital. We tell those who get tested and are found HIV positive how to lead a healthy life, how we will connect them to care, support and treatment services, put them on nutritional support and prevent further spread of the virus,\u201d Dr Rewari added. Dr Sandhya Kabra from NACO said, whenever a patient is found to be HIV positive, the test is repeated two more times to confirm the results. \u201cIf found negative, the test isn\u2019t repeated. But if the test gives a positive result, we repeat the test for extra confirmation. Testing without counseling can make a patient take drastic measures,\u201d Dr Kabra said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are about 50,000 new HIV infections every year. Many of these new infections are transmitted from people who are unaware of their HIV status. Clinical studies for self-testing have shown that the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test has an expected performance of 92% for test sensitivity, the percentage of results that will be positive when HIV is present. This means that one false negative result would be expected out of every 12 test results in HIV-infected individuals. Clinical studies also have shown that the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test has an expected performance of 99.98% for test specificity, the percentage of results that will be negative when HIV is not present. This means that one false positive would be expected out of every 5,000 test results in uninfected individuals. A variety of home tests finger pricks or mouth swabs are now being developed to be used by individuals to know their HIV status by sitting at home which can produce results in one-20 minutes. A UNAIDS report recently said the world was opening up to home testing for HIV since fewer than half of those living with HIV knew their status. This is a huge barrier to treatment scale up. \u201cDespite the advances in technology, testing is still approached with fear, accessing clinics is inconvenient and the experience of HIV testing is often stigmatizing. The cost of these tests is now measured in cents,\u201d UNAIDS said. In September, 2011, the United Kingdom\u2019s House of Lords\u2019 select committee on AIDS recommended repealing laws that prohibit home HIV testing."}

Speaking at the inauguration of a literacy campaign, he said the nuclear-family system has contributed to the rise in HIV/AIDS. Living in a joint family eradicates the possibility of having extra-marital affairs. In olden times, elders in joint families would watch over children, teach them to be good, and prevent them from going astray. Nuclear families give way for affairs, Ramdas said without explaining how they promote HIV/AIDS. The Ramayana teaches us to be loyal to our partner, the minister said, and gave Rama\u2019s example. Supporting primary education minister Visveswara Hedge Kageri, Ramdas said: \u201cThe concept of saffronization is nothing but teaching intellectual values to children through the Ramayana.\u201d Following the Ramayana is the best way to eradicate social evils; it would help to lead a good family life. Teaching the same in schools would benefit children. Interacting with children, he advised them to become like M Visvesvaraya and increase their intellectual level. \u201cWhoever studies in the English medium is not intelligent; children learning Kannada are not inferior.\u201d \u201cEvery day when you step out to go to school, seek blessings from your mother. It will benefit you in a big way,\u201d he told the children."}

Twenty-one NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and 13 community-based organizations (CBOs) that handle a total of 52 intervention projects for the city\u2019s population at highest risk of contacting and spreading HIV have not received central government funds since April. This blow comes at a time when already close to 60,000 of the 4.20 lakh individuals in the state afflicted with HIV are living in the city. Although its prevalence in the general population has been on a decline, the graph has only been rising for the high-risk groups. The crunch in funds has directly affected efforts made by agencies to protect an estimated 2.34 lakh high-risk individuals. They include female sex workers (FSW), transgender individuals, men having sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users (IDU), truckers and migrants. Currently, HIV prevalence among FSW is as high as 27%, 18% in IDUs, 12% in MSM and 30% in the transgender population. Following the fund crisis, most NGOs and CBOs have been forced to downsize their workforce and a few have even completely stalled their work. Funds allocated to each project vary from Rs 9 lakh to 20 lakh, depending on its reach. Without the money, most organizations have been unable to pay their staffers, and have defaulted on the rents and electricity bills. The worst hit are some former sex workers-turned-outreach workers and -peer educators, who have had to go back to their old ways to support their families. TOI came across one such outreach worker from Malwani who said she waited for two months for her salary of Rs 7,000 to arrive. \u201cOn the third month, I had no choice but to do the only work I knew,\u201d said the worker, who is associated with a CBO that caters to the transgender population. As an outreach worker, her job is to visit brothels to distribute condoms and inform new entrants about prevention. A Ghatkopar-based NGO told TOI that they were struggling to even purchase stationery for daily use while a south Mumbai CBO that works with MSM said they had to take huge loans to meet ends. Eldred Tellis, director of Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, said he had to borrow approximately Rs 7.5 lakh from his trust\u2019s buffer to sustain three IDU projects. \u201cThough bigger NGOs can sustain for a while, smaller organizations are finding it extremely difficult to cope,\u201d he said. Ashok Row Kavi, founder-chairperson of Humsafar Trust, also said three of his MSM projects were badly hit. \u201cWithout paying salaries, how can I expect my volunteers to be present at the site and distribute condoms everyday? This (fund crunch) has created a dent in the measures taken so far and an increase in HIV prevalence is likely,\u201d he said. Dr Balkrishna Adsul, additional project director of Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), said, \u201cThe delay was from NACO\u2019s end. But funds have arrived now and we have started disbursing it already.\u201d He also said the crunch at the Centre could be caused by the drying up of money from global agencies. Geneva-based Global Fund (GF) had announced stoppage of funds till 2014 for diseases, including HIV, in India. Dr Neeraj Dhingra, deputy director general, NACO, said he would check how and why the crunch happened. \u201cThere is sufficient money to fund projects as long as NGOs are clear with their records,\u201d he said."}

The conference is also supported by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and United Nations and will have government policy makers, social activists, health experts and students from across the globe attending the conference. \"I have never travelled outside the country and this is the first time I am getting an opportunity to travel to the state. I am sure it will be a good learning experience,\" said Narayanasamy. Nithyanandam Narayanasamy has been a member of the International AIDS society since 2008 and has been actively involved in spreading awareness about the disease and the rehabilitation of infected people who have to tackle the social stigma too. Initially, he was employed as a worker with Lakshmi Machine Works and at present he has a thermal flask selling outlet near Ondipudur in the city. Along with some like minded individuals, he formed a social collective called Thiyana social service centre to expand their social work. The district administration of Coimbatore has also felicitated Narayanasamy on numerous occasions for his work. \"The district AIDS society had issued an order in 2002 and I travelled across Coimbatore and visited more than 100 colleges and higher education centres to spread awareness about AIDS infection. I conducted more than 400 awareness camps across the district,\" Narayanasamy added. Narayanasamyu decided to join the International AIDS Conference to widen his network of social activities and also get in touch with similar work which is being carried out in other countries. Narayanasamy claimed that he had sent scanned copies of the certificates of appreciation from district administration and private social welfare organisations to the International AIDS Society and he got selected as a delegate for the conference. The travel expenses have to be borne by the delegates themselves but the remaining expenses will be borne by the society. He will leave for Delhi from Coimbatore on July 14 and will fly to Washington via Frankfurt on July 16. \"It is a good opportunity and also matter of pride to be part of such an international gathering of social workers and policy makers in the United States,\" said R Raveendran, honorary secretary, Residents Awareness Association of Coimbatore (RAAC). Narayanasamy had also been actively involved in the rehabilitation program of Tsunami victims and had also visited Bhuj in Gujarat as part of the relief work after the massive earthquake in 2001. Narayanasamy and a group of few like minded individuals in the city had collected medicines worth more than Rs 3 lakh to be sent to Gujarat through the Coimbatore district administration, he added."}

Mashroo is the chairman of this blood bank, which was being run on the Junagadh government hospital campus without registration. Even the HC raised various questions on the existence of this blood bank in the government premises and criticized former investigating officer \u2014 IPS Shobha Bhutada in harsh manner for going soft on the blood bank office bearers in her probe.

On June 17, the bench of acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala transferred the case to the CBI for further probe. This was despite strong objection from the state government. In transferring the probe, the court said that handing over the probe to an independent agency could instill confidence among people in circumstances, wherein inaction was apparent. Lately, even the CBI starting showing reluctance to take up probe in Gujarat, as in one of such cases the central agency claimed severe shortage of staff and maintained that most of its resources are engaged in the police encounter probes in Gujarat only, and it cannot summon other officials from Delhi.

He sits on the floor and cries, but his mother can't give him even a biscuit because the kitchen is barred to her. They are pariahs in their own home because they are HIV-positive. Mitali (name changed) and three-and-a-half-year-old Sanju don't have AIDS but the entire village shuns them as untouchables. Wild rumours go around that mosquitoes can bite the mother-son and spread the infection. And this is in Kharagpur, home to one of the premier tech institutes of the country and a three-hour drive from Kolkata. Sanju's father died from AIDS a little over a month ago. He worked as a private security guard at IIT-Kharagpur's Central School. As soon as he died, Mitali's in-laws tried to throw her and little Sanju out of the house, calling her a witch and a husband killer. However, Mitali's mother, who lives nearby, fought back fiercely and forced them to keep the mother-child. Sanju's father started complaining of a debilitating weakness and had constant attacks of cold and cough and stomach ailments in March this year. Gradually he became so weak that he couldn't go to work any longer and spent the day lying in bed. He was initially treated at Kharagpur subdivisional hospital, which sent him to Midnapore Medical College, where he was detected with full blown AIDS. Once they knew he had AIDS, the hospital refused to keep him. Mitali brought him back and he died on June 5. The local doctor then advised her and her two children to go for an HIV screening. Mitali and Sanju tested positive but her elder son, a six-year-old, was clean. Neither the family nor the locality knew the difference between HIV and AIDS and treated Mitali and Sanju like taboo. Mother-in-law Bakulrani was adamant that they would not live under the same roof. She called her daughter and son-in-law from Kolkata and gathered her other sons around her to throw out the mother and child. They tried to force Mitali's mother, Shampa Deb to take her back, but she refused. \"I live with my brother's family. I don't have space to take them back. Why should they be turned out of their own house? They don't have AIDS and even if they did, it is not infectious. What crime have they committed?\" asked Shampa, who often has to send food for Mitali and Sanju lest they go hungry. Shampa first approached local councillor Jaya Pal for help. Pal visited the family and persuaded Bakulrani against turning Mitali out. Kharagpur municipality chairman Jawahar Pal, the councillor's father-in-law, also came to the rescue. \"We found that not only her family but the entire Chatimtala area had turned against the poor woman and her son. The locals feared that her disease was contagious. They complained to me that if mosquitoes bit them and then bit others, the disease would spread. I have tried my best to alleviate such unscientific fears ,\" said Jawahar. The local Chatimtala Club also came around eventually. \"We were a little hesitant at first because we thought that the mother-child could infect others. But we have understood now and will ensure that theyMitali and her son are not turned out,\" said Kartick Kanungo, a club member. But not everyone in the locality is as aware. As Sanju toddled up to a grocery store to buy some lozenges, the shopkeeper shooed him away. \"Stand outside the shop, keep the money there and leave,\" the shopkeeper said, throwing the candies at the boy. \"I think she is a polluted woman who gave her husband and son the disease. She should suffer,\" said a neighbour. The district's chief medical officer (health), Sabitendra Patra, promised regular monitoring of Mitali and her son from Saturday. A medical team will be sent to spread awareness in the neighbourhood. \"We first need to contain the panic in the area. We will educate people so that the mother and son are treated with compassion. We will also take care of their treatment. Since they are HIV-positive, they will have to be under medication throughout their lives,\" said West Midnapore district magistrate Surendra Gupta. The district has 306 HIV-positive patients."}

A scientist who shared a Nobel prize for the discovery of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has now added her voice to those who believe it is possible to cure a viral infection that until now has been considered life-long , chronic and, although treatable, ultimately incurable. Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi , who first reported the discovery of the Aids virus in 1983 with her colleague Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, cited this week the case of the \u201cBerlin Patient\u201d , an American gay man called Timothy Brown who received a bone marrow transplant in 2007 while a student in Germany . The transplant was undertaken to treat a type of blood cancer but in the process it also apparently cured Mr Brown of his HIV infection. Five years after his transplant, he continues to be free of HIV despite having given up his anti-viral drugs. It is still not clear to scientists why Mr Brown has managed to shrug off his chronic HIV infection so effectively. For decades, a cure for Aids has been little more than a pipe dream because of the ability of the virus to integrate itself within the genetic material of infected patients. Once installed within a patient\u2019s DNA, the Aids virus could \u201chide away\u201d for years, even decades, from the body\u2019s immune defences. As a result, scientists realised soon after HIV was discovered in the early 1980s that infected people would continue to be at risk of developing Aids throughout their life unless continuously treated with anti-viral drugs. But Mr Brown\u2019s highly unusual case has given some scientists cause for optimism. In a comment article in this week\u2019s Nature, Professor Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and her colleague Professor Steven Deeks of the University of California, San Francisco, say that Mr Brown has been effectively cured of HIV \u2014 the first person in the world to fulfil the strict scientific definition of a cure. Professor Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and Professor Deeks took part this week in the launch of a global scientific strategy document for Aids and HIV prior to the 2012 International Aids Conference which begins next week. The document will place \u201ccure research\u201d centre stage, suggesting that instead of focusing almost exclusively on research into better anti-viral drugs and HIV vaccines, scientists should think about ways of curing patients outright.

Earlier this week, the Food and Drug Administration approved a daily pill, Truvada, which reduces the risk of HIV infection. A team of researchers from the University of Nebraska Medical Center is progressing towards developing weekly or twice-monthly injectable antiretroviral therapy (ART) nanomedicines for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A long-acting, nanoformulated ART (nanoART) would be a substantive improvement over daily and sometimes more complex regimen of pills, lead investigator on the development of nanoART for HIV/AIDS and professor and chairman of the department of pharmacology and experimental neuroscience (PEN) at UNMC, Howard Gendelman, MD, said. A journal article hails the successful testing of UNMC\u2019s ART injectables as treatment of HIV-infected mice and in preventing new infections. \u201cWe actually followed the process exactly as we would with a person \u2013 and it worked,\u201d Dr. Gendelman said. \u201cThis is all very exciting. Although there are clear pitfalls ahead and the medicines are not yet ready for human use, the progress is undeniable.\u201d Dr. Gendelman said one of the project\u2019s real advantages is in the nanoformulations. \u201cNanoART is cell directed. So when you take a pill, the pill travels throughout the body indiscriminately. In these nanomedicines, you can use the body\u2019s own cells to direct the medicine where you want it to go,\u201d he said. The UNMC project directs the medicine to the monocyte-macrophage, cells which carry the drug particle to sites of the body specifically where HIV grows. \u201cYou\u2019re using the cell that is the target for the virus to deliver the drug against the virus,\u201d Dr. Gendelman said. Dr. Gendelman calls the progress made \u201ca Nebraska invention,\u201d as it involved so many of the state\u2019s scientists in different disciplines working together. He said this marks the third article his team has had published in major biomedical journals in recent months with all the articles related to the nanomedicine injectable therapy. The advance to use the new nanomedicines to specifically target reservoirs for viral infection was explained by Georgette Kanmogne, Ph.D., associate professor in PEN, lead investigator, and published in the International Journal of Nanomedicine. This paper describes how these drug inventions can enter the brain and ameliorate nervous system disease. The third study, published in Trends in Neurosciences, is a research area led by Larisa Poluektova, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor in PEN, and the developer of the mouse models of HIV/AIDS used in study. \u201cWe work as a team and work effectively as a team with different scientists with very different disciplines involved in different aspects of the work,\u201d Dr. Gendelman said. This research team is made up of two UNMC colleges, four departments and two universities. The drugs were developed in UNMC labs using nanoformulation approaches. The ART tests in mouse models were made possible by UNMC\u2019s development of specially designed mice. Because mice cannot catch human HIV, UNMC has developed mice with the equivalent of a human immune system. Such a mouse model enables advanced tests on HIV and its treatment. Dr. Kanmogne said an ART injection would be an improvement for HIV patients because it would produce all the medicine needed without the complications of remembering to take pills daily, drug toxicities, buildup of viral resistance, intestinal problems, or the social stigma of pills. The work will be presented at the forthcoming meeting for the American Society for Nanomedicine, where Dr. Gendelman will serve as conference chair. The study has been recently published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases."}

Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Bethesda, Md., made the recommendation at a JAMA media briefing at the International AIDS Conference. Among the most important interventions is combination antiretroviral therapy, which significantly improves the health and longevity of individuals infected with HIV. \u201cSince the advent of antiretroviral therapy, the annual number of deaths due to AIDS has decreased by two-thirds in the United States. Globally, an estimated 700,000 lives were saved in 2010 alone due to the increased availability of antiretroviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries,\u201d Dr. Fauci and Gregory K. Folkers, M.S., M.P.H., also of the NIAID, wrote. \u201cImportant challenges remain\u2014notably finding the resources and developing the infrastructure to provide antiretroviral therapy to the estimated 8 million individuals with HIV infection who need these drugs but are not receiving them,\u201d they noted. The researchers added that antiretroviral therapy could also prevent HIV infection by reducing the amount of virus in an infected person''s blood and other body fluids, making it less likely that the virus will be transmitted to others. Also, antiretroviral therapy is highly effective in blocking mother-to-child HIV transmission. Other important interventions include medical male circumcision, which offers a highly effective and durable way to protect heterosexual men from HIV infection; and potentially, pre-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral medications, which have shown promise in reducing an individual''s risk of acquiring HIV infection. \u201cEach of these treatment and prevention strategies has a strong evidence base; with further refinement and scale-up and also when used in combination, they could have an extraordinary effect on decreasing the trajectory of the HIV pandemic,\u201d they said. They said researchers are maintaining focus on 2 key scientific challenges that remain: the development of a vaccine and a cure. They wrote that modest success in a large-scale clinical trial of an HIV vaccine, promising results in animal models, and advances in structure-based vaccine design suggest that an HIV vaccine is feasible. The prospect of an HIV cure remains challenging. The researchers concluded that ending the global HIV/AIDS pandemic \u201cwill require a global commitment of resources involving additional donor countries, strengthening health care systems overall, and fostering greater ownership by host countries of HIV/AIDS effort, including investing more in the health of their people. With collective and resolute action now and a steadfast commitment for years to come, an AIDS-free generation is indeed within reach.\u201d Their recommendation appeared in the latest issue of JAMA, a theme issue on HIV/AIDS."}

Minister of state for labour Mangilal Garasiya on Monday said the policy will be formulated after a discussion with employers, labour unions and the state government. The policy will aim to achieve zero new HIV infections among workers. Garasiya was addressing a gathering of officials of Central government, state's labour department, International Labour Organization, Ministry of labour and employment and Rajasthan State Aids Control Society at a workshop on 'National Policy on HIV/AIDS and the World of Work' in the city. Garasiya said it should be the government's priority to prevent spread of HIV/AIDS among people in the age group of 15-49 years. \"The spread of HIV/AIDS among labourers has adverse impact on productivity; therefore, it is essential to check it.\" Experts claimed that nearly 90% of the reported HIV infections are diagnosed in the most productive age group. The stigma and social discrimination towards HIV/AIDS patients also needs to be discouraged. Additional secretary, Union labour ministry Ravi Mathur said a National policy on HIV/AIDS and world of work has been recently formulated. He also stressed on the need for zero discrimination towards HIV patients at the workplace. Principal secretary, labour Lalit Mehra said, \"It is necessary to discuss with employers and labour unions before formulating workplace policy in the state.\" The participants also talked about discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS at workplace. They advocated that such discrimination should not be happen in workplace as people living with HIV/AIDS have right to earn in a dignified way. The Union labour ministry also provided a checklist for planning and implementing a workplace policy and programme on HIV/AIDS. The objective of the workshop was to provide complete information of the national policy on HIV/AIDS in the world of work to help the stakeholders in developing plans to fight against HIV/AIDS in the world of work."}

This August 15, Kripa Foundation, which works with recovering addicts, will celebrate its 31st Founders Day and it's been over 25 years since they started a branch in Goa at Anjuna. Pereira warns that because of this party culture, permissive sexual behaviour, specially among women, has also increased and Goa is sitting on a HIV time-bomb. \"Unfortunately Goan society has a false sense of status. They're into denial that they have any problem. They're so scared of shame that they will never admit that they're alcoholics or drug addicts.

The disruption of these reservoirs is critical to finding a cure for AIDS. Researchers at UNC, working in collaboration with scientists from the Harvard School of Public Health, National Cancer Institute and the University of California undertook a series of experiments designed to evaluate the potential of the drug vorinostat . Vorinosta is a deacetylase inhibitor that is used to treat some types of lymphoma, to activate and disrupt the dormant virus. Laboratory experiments measuring active HIV levels in CD4+T cells, which are specialized white blood cells that the virus uses to replicate, showed that vorinostat unmasked the hidden virus in these cells. Subsequently, vorinostat was administered to eight HIV-infected men who were medically stable on antiretroviral therapy and the levels of active HIV virus were measured and compared to the levels prior to administration."}

Menabde was speaking at the inauguration of the \u2018Health Liver\u2019 campaign by Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), India\u2019s first NABH accredited super specialty institute. Delhi health minister AK Walia and K Srinath Reddy, director of the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), among others, were present on the occasion. Menabde said there are five main hepatitis viruses, types A, B, C, D and E, of which B and C are most lethal as they can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. She added, \u201cAbout six lakh people die every year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis B, nearly 100 times more than HIV/AIDS.\u201d Walia said that both hepatitis B and C spread through contact with the blood of an infected person. It can be through transfusion of infected blood, sharing of contaminated needles or injection material. Hepatitis B can also be transmitted from mother to child. \u201cTo check the spread of the disease through blood transfusion, we are going to introduce Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) to ensure immediate and accurate screening of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV in donated blood,\u201d Walia said. He added that Delhi is among the first few states to have introduced vaccination for hepatitis B in the universal immunization programme. Hepatitis A and E, the commonest forms of viral hepatitis, spread mainly through contaminated food or water. The state health minister said that they are taking all measures to ensure clean drinking water facility to all citizens. The Delhi government is also planning to provide increased financial assistance to poor patients undergoing liver transplant, kidney transplant and other super-specialty procedures \u2014 Rs 3 lakh for those undergoing treatment at private hospitals and Rs 5 lakh for those being treated by government hospitals.

Andhra Pradesh, which accounts for 5 lakh of the 24 lakh HIV positive in the country, remains the state with the most number of HIV-infected people, official statistics show. Government and private initiatives have helped reduce the number of people infected each year in the state, said officials of Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TNSACS). \u201cAround 27,000 people tested positive for HIV in the state in 2009,\u201d said a TNSACS official. \u201cIn 2010, the number dropped to 23,000, and in 2011, it fell further to 20,000.

Fewer migrant workers than before are testing positive each year. Red ribbon clubs are also doing good work at college level.\u201d According to Dr Lakshmibai, intervention programmes prevented the disease from reaching generalised epidemic proportions. \u201cThere are three levels \u2014 nascent epidemic, concentrated epidemic and generalised epidemic,\u201d she said. \u201cThe state never let it reach the generalised stage. When it looked like our intervention programs were only creating awareness and not changing behaviour, the state brought in specialised programmes.\u201d Andhra Pradesh, on the other hand, shut down 266 of its first-level detection and counselling centres due to a cash crunch. However, Dr Lakshmibai added that although Tamil Nadu is doing well, sustaining the effort to reduce the incidence of new cases will be a challenge. \u201cTrends and sexual behaviour keeps changing,\u201d she said. \u201cAgencies have to keep track of all developments while designing preventive programmes.\u201d The state also has its work cut out in its intervention programme for transgenders. \u201cThe first survey was done only recently and shows that 9% of transgenders in the state are HIV-positive, a higher ratio than the 6% of female sex workers,\u201d Dr Lakshmibai said."}

Many times, the government representatives themselves are either unaware or not sensitive enough to work for the People Living with HIV (PLHIV). The condition of children living with HIV (CLHIV) is still worse with not many paediatricians versed with care required for these children. These were amongst the few grievances expressed by HIV positive people during the three-day grassroots level advocacy workshop organized by NGO World Vision India. Forty PLHIVs and many other NGOs participated. NGOs working in the field of HIV/AIDS like Sanjeevan, District Level PLHA Network, Eficor, Saathii, CRTDP, IID, Women Resource Center, Sharansthan, National Council of Churches in India also participated. \"The workshop aimed to strengthen the advocacy capacity of communities to address the issues faced by women and children living with HIV in different areas of the district. We wanted the PLHIVs to get the attention they deserve from the policymakers, the media, and society,\" said Joe George, programme officer of World Vision Nagpur. The participants discussed several practical difficulties faced by them every day. \"There are no facilities for AIDS patients at village level. With the government deciding to link us with the NRHM workers, this may change. For children suffering from the disease, it would make a huge difference if government provided them nutrition,\" said Anil Dalve, president of Network for PLHIV in Maharashtra. \"The number of ART centres in the state is insufficient if we consider the fact that Maharashtra has 14% of the Indians with the disease. All these people will soon require second line treatment too. I hope the government plans to open more centres,\" said Dalve. Daisy David, a PLHIV who now works as an advocacy associate, believes the government has good structure but what they lack is implementation and monitoring. \"When the district programme officers for AIDS speak to the NGOs working at the grassroots, they discuss projects and funds but rarely issues. They can't travel to all the villages under their jurisdiction and are unaware of the shortcomings in medical services in many of them,\" she said. If these authorities could guide and help the PLHIVs, things could improve a lot, she said.

During animal trials in 1996, the vaccine gave immunity to mice and monkeys from HIV sub-type C, which constitute over 95 per cent of HIV infections in India. The vaccine research had faced problems in 2002 as activists staged protest against use of animals in the tests following which trials on monkeys were then shifted to IISc Bangalore. The research had come to a stop after retirement of the developer of the vaccine, Dr Pradeep Seth, from AIIMS earlier this year. Dr Seth had headed the microbiology department of the premier institute. \"ICMR has revived the efforts and all clearance will be hopefully in place by this year,\" he said.

Ironically, India still seems to be grappling with problems of what some call 'an invisible population group' - Children Living with HIV (CLHIV). With insufficient government facilities for them, these children have become the first casualties of the drying up of funds being forwarded towards HIV affected people, nationally and internationally. Along with the social and psychological trauma that these kids have to go through, the physical troubles they suffer also multiply in the absence of medical services for them. Most of the NGOs who were working for this deprived lot have either phased out or are in the process of phasing out their projects. Last year, National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) withdrew financial support from many social outfits associated with the cause. \"A very few doctors understand the need of HIV-infected children. and so provide care to them. Despite being innocent recipients of the virus for no fault of their own, these children are forced to live a life full of despair and denial,\" said Samir Shinde, who has been working since the last few years to improve the condition of CLHIV. He also says that the facilities for screening and check-up of these children are insufficient. \"There is no focused government or NGO programme for the kids. Even the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) medicine dosages are too strong for most children, which is a reason for other health problems,\" he added. Madhuri Giri, project coordinator for Sanjeevan, another NGO working for the positive people, said that efforts made by activists end up wasted because of changing government authorities. \"We have discussed the issues with many officials but they get transferred before they can act on the suggestions. In terms of government schemes, these children come under ICDS, where too there is no special mention of their special health and nutritional needs,\" she said. Pointing out that organizations will only help the kids till they have the project or the money, Giri underlined the need for a government project towards this end. Lack of medical facilities for the children is amongst is another big hurdle, believes social worker Manohar Roy from Eastern Studies Society. \"There is no paediatrician trained to deal with the other infections that afflict these kids because of their weaker immunity. As opposed to this, the facilities for the elders are a little better and improving. This is simply because a Person Living with HIV (PLHIV) is a part of the vote bank, children are not,\" he said. If the dos and don'ts are explained to these kids properly, it is possible for them to be a part of the society, he said while explaining the need for emotional, psychological and medical counselling for the kids. Director of India Peace Centre John Chelladurai agrees and adds, \"To an extent, some facilities are still there in urban and district centres but not in smaller towns and villages. We can't keep blaming the government as society also needs to be more proactive.\" Education may have become the right of every child, but not many schools readily accept children having AIDS, said Harshan KY of Eficor. \"Most of these children become orphans early with nobody to take care of them. From the government's side, all they get is ART treatment, but no nutritional support that can help them have stronger immunity,\" he said. Support Suggestions Focused programme aimed to improve the condition of Children Living with HIV (CLHIV) At least one doctor of each discipline in every city should be trained to handle these children Private schools can also take up at least one positive child each Dosage of medicines be made suitable for children Providing facilities like institutional care, palliative care and immunization for the children Nutritional support, in the form of health supplements like vitamins, along with ART provided by government Making care takers aware of the special immunization schedules for CLHIVs Counseling of High Risk Groups to limit the number of children who are born with the infection City NGOs' 24x7 care centre for +ve kids Looking at the dismal way of life Children Living with HIV (CLHIV) are forced to live in the country, some city NGO's decided to change the scenario. Having completed three years of running a day care centre Tehillim Ministries of Charity (TMC), Maharashtra Positive Women's Network and National Integration Society, they are now aiming at establishing a centre of excellence for CLHIVs. They will now be extending the care provided in their centre to be available 24x7. The ever increasing number of children with the disease, most of whom have lost their parents, they say are denied treatment in government establishments and can't afford that provided by private institutions. The centre will also be providing the children counseling and treatment facilities. \"With constant care being very necessary for these kids, we thought of supporting them in every possible way. Also, if the government can not provide something, instead of complaining, we thought of taking up their cause,\" said Jefferey Nelson, president of TMC, while explaining the idea behind the centre of excellence. Most CHLIVs are either orphan or semi-orphan, so they do not get the constant care they need, said Varsha Gaikwad, president Positive Women's Network. \"They need regular follow-ups for which not many doctors are available. Also, preventive care is more important for them in the absence of which they know the existence of diseases only when it is in the last stage,\" she said. Since the volunteers of these organizations have known most of the kids through the years and know their medical history, they are better equipped to help them, she believes. President of National Integration Society Achchelal Chauhan believes that the project acquires more importance since the government facilities available earlier do not exist any longer. \"The government provided facilities like Community Care Centre (CCCs) earlier. But that too was shut down a year ago. The children are being provided with medicines by the government, but not the necessary information and emotional support,\" he said. For support or queries call on 9890915857."}

This would be in addition to the 10 ART centres already existing in the state. This was announced by health minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey here on Thursday. The state government has also decided to give preference in jobs to people with AIDS, while process is also on to provide pension to them. People with AIDS would also be carried free to and fro the ART centres. All these measures were announced on Thursday when a specially designed train, Red Ribbon Express, entered Bihar via Kishanganj district. The train, which will pass through Bihar in two phases, August 23- September 10 and October 13-October 29, would cover 16 districts of Bihar. Red Ribbon Express has special audio-visual systems to create awareness about causes of HIV/AIDS. It also has a condom vending machine, a Bihar State Aids Control Society (BSACS) official said. It was flagged off from New Delhi on January 12 this year. Choubey said there was an urgent need to involve more and more people in creating awareness about AIDS at every level as there is a misconception that it is a contagious disease. It occurs due to unsafe sex, contaminated blood transfusion and from mother to child during pregnancy or breastfeeding, Choubey said, adding involving rural people, particularly youth, in this programme would help create awareness about it. Awareness would also be created at different fairs of the state, including the Sonepur fair, the minister said. There are around 12,000 people with AIDS in Bihar, while another 50,000 are HIV +. The largest number of HIV+ people are in Patna district. Migration of people from other districts to Patna for treatment has increased the number of HIV positive people in the district, a health department official said. There are 207 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres where people are tested for HIV and counselled if they like, Choubey said. \"Bihar has sought help from the Centre for making arrangements of HIV/AIDS investigation at every health centre across the state.\""}

Even if she looks healthy, she must be protected from any chance of infection,\" she added. Usha Devi isn't a doctor, just a neo-literate woman from a village in Purnia. But thanks to a collaborative effort of some NGOs in Bihar, she's equipped with enough basic knowledge and confidence to help HIV positive people and their families battle discrimination. Some 35 women, all grassroots workers with the Bihar Mahila Samakhya Society, attended a training programme conducted by the local Sambad 0612- 275757Helpline, Bihar's only HIV-AIDS counselling service in English, Hindi, Bhojpuri, Maithili, and Patna dialect. \"Don't hit us with information on how AIDS is acquired. We know that. Tell us what to do when someone has AIDS, how to handle it and how to help,\" echoed 25-year-old Suman Kumari from Supaul. \"We want to know where to get tested, where to get medicines, how to treat these patients at home where there is no hospital,\" she said. HIV and AIDS is no longer a remote exotic disease for Bihar's villages and towns. Every day government and private labs handle hundreds of HIV tests and, as a technician from the Kurji Holy Family Hospital (KHFH) put it, \"Every week, there's bound to be one or two HIV positive result in the blood samples tested. It's not something rare, like a decade ago. There's more testing, there's more awareness.\" Shantwana Bharti, who looks after women's legal affairs at Mahila Samakhya, said, \"Every block in Bihar has 20-30 persons who are locally known to be infected. So, it is all the more important how to tell the people to manage HIV and AIDS, because it is ignorance that breeds fear. And this fear leads to violence or the expulsion of the affected person.\" Nineteen-year-old Shruti Sinha insisted that she as well as her would-be husband should be tested for HIV. \"My parents were shocked. They felt really embarrassed to bring such a subject to the guy's family,\" she said. On her insistence, the boy agreed that it was the sensible thing to do. Imagine her distress when the results showed that it was Shruti, and not the boy, who was HIV positive. Two years before, Shruti had undergone a blood transfusion at a private clinic. Her AB negative group was rare. So the blood was 'arranged'. The clinic claimed that the blood was 'tested'. \"The test shattered my dreams. I wanted to sue the clinic. Here, the legal process is complicated. I was shattered and angry,\" she said. Her parents were traumatized. \"What we need is information on how to live with HIV, not just how to prevent it,\" she says. Her father spent lots of money on 'Ayurvedic treatment' for HIV. It was only after a prolonged discussion with AIDS counsellors that he realized that such 'medicines' were no substitute for the antiretroviral therapy (ART). Shruti is gainfully employed at a call centre in Patna, but she still remains 'in the closet'. \"The poor cannot afford to buy ART from private sources. They need a dependable supply, and the supply is often erratic. ART is a complicated regimen and the medicines have to be administered strictly according to time. It is better the family learn how to prolong the 'good health' window of an infected person by simple and balanced diet and avoiding any chance for infection,\" says Sister Francina, who runs a community care centre for AIDS patients on the KHFH campus. Bihar is changing, but where's the change in attitude? That's what Shalini, a IInd-year student of JD Women's College asks. The AIDS education programmes are of 1990s vintage. The ground reality has changed, point out experts. For example, the myth about HIV infection from a used razor has long been smashed, because the virus is too fragile to survive outside its medium for more than a few seconds. But people are still told that you can get HIV through 'infected blades'. Bihar State Aids Control Society needs to tune up. \"We need proper access to the ART and more community care centres, not just the so-called Behaviour Change and Information Education Communication. Government must ensure safe blood products, and close illegal blood banks. We need doctors who are supportive, sensitive, and knowledgeable. Many government doctors aren't updated on the latest information. This can be seen from the way they shun HIV positive patients. We need to talk about care, support and life rather than repeat the same tired slogan, 'AIDS kills'. Young people don't pay attention to the same old messages,\" says Sanjeet Singh, an active member of the Bihar Network of Positive People. Says Anshuman, a psychology (hons) student of AN College, \"Times are changing. India now belongs to people under-30. That's the reality of life. Lifestyle has changed. Condoms and HIV management are parts of life. No use trying to turn the clock back by banning this and stopping that. It's time to deal with it.\" (Some names of women have been changed to protect their identity)"}

NAT PCR is regarded as the most accurate test to identify HIV infection, far more dependable than the Elisa and rapid test kit methods in which HIV may remain undetected for a prolonged window period. Making the announcement during an adjournment motion discussion in the Odisha assembly, health minister Damodar Rout said the test was quite costly and the government had decided to introduce the test at the three government-run medical colleges and the Capital Hospital in the first phase. It will be introduced at other places in a phased manner, he added. Admitting that two specific cases of HIV transmission through contaminated blood had come to the government's notice, the minister said, \"The government will take all required steps to ensure people have access to safe blood.\" Rout explained that the window period of HIV non-detection is 89 days in rapid test kits, and 21 days in Elisa method. In case of NAT PCR, the window period is only seven days. The minister further said the government had decided to abolish the rapid test method completely as it had the highest margin of error. The National AIDS Control Organization and National Blood Transfusion Council have no directives to conduct NAT PCR tests, but countrywide, around 20 blood banks use the method, he informed the house. Raising the motion earlier, Congress chief whip Prasad Harichandan wanted to know what steps the government had taken in view of the \"increase in instances of infected blood being given by blood banks.\" Citing a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the law maker said the prevalent methods were unsafe. The ICMR study, undertaken in various centres including the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, and Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi, was published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research in 2008. It shows that the NAT PCR method can detect one HIV positive case in every 1,500 blood samples tested negative in the Elisa method. The test, if introduced in six nodal blood banks across the state, would cost around Rs 11 crore to test over 1.81 lakh units of blood in a year. An automated NAT PCR machine costs around Rs 3 crore. The Orissa high court, in July 28, 2011, had asked the state government to ensure that the NAT PCR method is used identify HIV infection. A bench of Chief Justice V Gopala Gowda and Justice B N Mahapatra had passed the order while hearing the petition of a resident of Badamba in Cuttack district. The petitioner's son was transfused blood collected from Red Cross Blood Bank in Municipal Hospital in Bhubaneswar before a surgery at Neelachal Hospital when he was 10-month old. He tested positive for HIV at the age of 17 months."}

In such cases, a cochlear implant is a better option as it utilizes the existing inner hair cells, however less in number, to ensure that the sound waves reach the nerves connected to these cells,\" said senior ENT surgeon Dr Madan Kapre, who is also the secretary of Neeti Cochlear Implant Trust. Dr Kapre said he was always amazed by the fact that though the manuals and brochures about the implants had pictures of adults and even elderly, none of the Indian manufacturers he knew was making such implants for the elderly. \"In fact, it would be easier for the implants to be used for the geriatric population as unlike children they have their nerves and brains are used to the function of carrying and interpreting sound waves,\" he said. GSI secretary and preventive geriatrician Dr Sanjay Bajaj says that these implants can also improve the quality of life of the elderly, which is why the society is advocating their use. \"I know of a lot of my patients who are working professionally beyond the age of 60. Hearing impairment hampers not only their work but also social life. For the others, their family life gets affected and they may get isolated. The hearing aids come with their set of problems from having to charge batteries and removal and fixing of the aids again and again,\" he said. The financial and social independence and the increased level of physical fitness that the elderly people are enjoying these days should make it easier for them to avail of this facility, he added."}

The NACO has placed five UP districts, including Allahabad, Azamgarh, Deoria, Etawah and Banda under its scanner after these districts were placed under sensitive category in migration of HIV/AIDS infected persons. Allahabad being termed most sensitive, greater stress is being laid on collecting actual data of victims from all 20 blocks of the district and offering treatment and counseling to patients. UPSACS officials of are carrying out an intensive drive to check the health status of migrants and identify their locations with an aim to offer them counseling and treatment as well as assistance. They are also conducting studies regarding the migration pattern and prevalence of HIV.. Nodal officer, District Aids Programme Control Unit ( DAPCU), Dr O P Shahi told TOI that migrant labourers, truckers and MSM (men having sex with men) were being identified in the district as they were most responsible for and vulnerable to spread of the deadly disease. He added that efforts were underway to identify them so that they could be offered best possible treatment and counselling. During surveys, it has come to notice that victims due to various reasons including social stigma, do not come forward and reel under depression, said Dr Shahi. Three kinds of migrants are primarily responsible for the spread of the deadly disease including workers at brick kilns, stone cutting, mining, silica mining centres and service clusters (who migrate from one state to another for employment. Dr Shahi said under the directives of NACO and UPACS, district health authorities are busy locating the infected persons with the aim of offering them treatment, assistance and counseling. Officials are also mapping high-risk groups like female sex workers, intravenous drug users and men having sex with men (MSM) so that concrete measures could be initiated to restrict the spread of the virus. UPSACS officials have also been spreading awareness under the information, education and communication (IEC) programme. Last year, a NACO monitoring committee visited the city to find reasons behind the rapid increase in transmission of HIV in the district. The team had also inspected services being offered to HIV+ and AIDS patients at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC). The NACO initiative comes in the wake of Allahabad being placed under the high risk group as far as spread of HIV is concerned. Dr Shahi informed that the villages prone to high risk have been put under the scanner and a series of awareness and educational camps are being launched to check the menace. Pointedly, NACO has also asked UPSACS to check the status of migrants living in these villages as they are among prime carriers of HIV in the district. As far as route of infection and risk transmission categories are concerned, in about 85.3 per cent cases the disease spreads due to unsafe sexual contact, while 3.80 per cent, 2.05 per cent, 3.34 per cent and 6.46 per cent cases are due to prenatal transmission, blood transfusion, injectable drug users and others, respectively. Currently, three NGOs are implementing the targeted interventions among the high risk groups in the district covering commercial female sex workers (FSWs), men having sex with men (MSM) and Intravenous drug users."}

In fact, Varsha Gaikwad, Minister, Women and Child Development, recently said that her department had sought opinions in this regard from UNICEF and NGOs working for the welfare of HIV patients. But to bring about this rule, amendments to provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and other allied Acts, will be needed. And even though it looks like the need of the hour, it\u2019s not that simple. In the past, such a move has encountered a number of hindrances. Why some people are opposing the move: Some argue that making this test mandatory infringes upon a person\u2019s right to privacy, which is a fundamental human right. Also, a big concern is that post-tests, an infected person may be ostracised in his/her community. A generalised policy like this could adversely affect HIV control programme itself, as fear of social discrimination could force people to flee rather than come forward to declare their HIV status. That apart, there are people opposing it because of the veracity of HIV tests. A wrong diagnosis could cause havoc in a person's life. Besides, there is something called a window period during which a person may test negative despite being infected. Says gynaecologist Dr Firuza Parekh, \"The HIV test is not fool-proof. At the time of testing, a person may come negative but turn positive six months later due to the window period. That apart, there's also the question of who will bear the cost of the test. So, what are we trying to prove through these tests? Is it just promiscuity because in that case, a person could even cheat by getting somebody else's test result.\" Sexologist and marriage counsellor Dr Shirish Malde, agrees. \"People might resort to getting fake test reports. Also, asking for this test can give rise to certain trust issues,\" he says. But the fact is that there are many cases where a person has contracted the virus from his/her partner and often it comes to fore when the woman is pregnant, he says. \"And the person who was already infected at the time of marriage tends to pretend or actually may not even have been aware. So making such a test mandatory before marriage may help,\" This test is as important as kundlis: In Mumbai, a large section of people, especially youngsters, are of the opinion that the test must be made mandatory. \"People are worried to ask a potential groom in particular for a test, lest it upsets him and his family. But, it's as important as checking the kundlis in current times,\" says 26-year-old Tina Raina, a computer professional. A thought echoed by may others. Dr I S Gilada, President of AIDS Society of India, who has been working in this field for almost three decades, emphasises, \"This step may upset some people in our traditional society who might even call of a marriage. It's mainly young unsuspecting women who suffer in this. Human rights activists may say that declaring HIV status of one person to the other is violation of his/ her privacy. But doesn\u2019t the potential spouse have a right to be protected from the disease? One\u2019s right to privacy cannot infringe upon another\u2019s right to life. In fact if it is made mandatory, there will be more awareness and more people going in for regular checkups.\" What's the solution: Instead of just an HIV test, a couple about to get married could undergo a comprehensive health check-up that includes tests for diabetes, thalassemia, haemophilia and other sexually transmitted diseases. \"This way we can ensure better medical compatibility between partners. And even if a partner tests positive for HIV, he/she can be rejected only as 'medically unfit' and won't have to carry the stigma of an HIV/AIDS patient. Vice-verse, if they decide to go ahead with the marriage, it is with fullest knowledge and understanding, so they can\u2019t blame anyone,\" says Gilada.

Raima Sen, actress: If such a bill is being considered, I\u2019m glad it is because we definitely need this, especially in areas where education levels are low. Many suffer because of not having knowledge and rather than that suffering, it\u2019s better you are aware of things beforehand. Siddharth Dhanvant Shangvi, author: There\u2019s no clear-cut answer. In principle it seems logical enough: both partners should make an informed decision. But by legalising the process, not only do you bring the state into the bedroom, you also stigmatise HIV further. After all, there are many conditions that must be ascertained before we enter a partnership. Why aren\u2019t those investigated? Nandana Sen, actress: Making the test mandatory could intensify the inhuman stigmatisation that HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients grapple with. Brides and grooms must be encouraged to take the test before marriage, but it should be voluntary. Rakhi Sawant, TV actress: I totally agree with the government and feel everybody must go for a check-up every six months. Nowadays, people are indulging in all kinds of vices. Today, a wife doesn\u2019t know if her husband has been in a relationship with another man or woman! Anushka Manchanda, singer: In our country, where there is still a very prevalent arranged marriage system, a mandatory HIV test would be a boon. Due to our conservative society, these questions are barely asked. Mugdha Godse, actress: Alarming statistics show how children suffer because of their parents being HIV positive and women who not find out if their husbands are HIV positive suffer. It\u2019s thus best to be aware. Sahil Shroff, actor and model: Everyone should get an AIDS test; the government should organise this free of cost and have an awareness campaign on sex education. What is more of a concern, is how we treat those who are AIDS victims. Mukul Dev, actor: I totally support this move to have an HIV test before marriage; especially when one is beginning a family.

Researchers from the Imperial College London claim that their visual sensor technology is ten times more sensitive than the current gold standard methods for measuring biomarkers. These indicate the onset of diseases such as prostate cancer and infection by viruses including HIV. The colour of a liquid changes to give either a positive or negative result. Researchers say their sensor would benefit countries where sophisticated detection equipment is scarce, enabling cheaper and simpler detection and treatments for patients. The team tested the effectiveness of the sensor by detecting a biomarker called p24 in blood samples, which indicates HIV infection. \"Unfortunately, the existing gold standard detection methods can be too expensive to be implemented in parts of the world where resources are scarce,\" Professor Molly Stevens, from the Departments of Materials and Bioengineering, said. \"Our approach affords for improved sensitivity, does not require sophisticated instrumentation and it is ten times cheaper, which could allow more tests to be performed for better screening of many diseases,\" said Stevens. Researchers also tested samples for the biomarker called Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), which is an early indicator for Prostate Cancer. The team say the sensor can also be reconfigured for other viruses and diseases where the specific biomarker is known."}

The next month, he will take part in the 4th Mr World Championship in Bangkok. A resident of Khamnam Leirak in Imphal West, Pradip (43) disclosed his health status to the media a few days after bagging the 60-kg category senior 'Mr Manipur' title in a state-level competition held here in December, 2007. Pradip, a brand ambassador of Manipur Aids Control Society (Macs), later bagged silver and bronze medals in different national competitions and stood eighth in the 'Mr World' competition. Manipur is one of the six high HIV/AIDS prevalence states of the country. According to Macs, the state has 38,016 people infected with HIV, including 10,109 women and 2,578 children. Pradip, who has emerged as an icon of inspiration to the world, spends around Rs 40,000 in procuring foreign nutritional diet every month. \"Macs, which used to pay Rs 8,000 a month for my nutritional support, has stopped extending the amount since June this year,\" Pradip informed TOI on Monday. \"The state government which had promised to appoint me as a regular employee in the youth affairs and sports department in 2009 also failed to do anything about it. This was another major setback,\" said Pradip. A group of HIV positive widows of the state launched a charity campaign to collect money for him after they came to know about his financial condition. They are providing me monetary help and I am very thankful to them, he said. Recently, a social organization donated Rs 1.5 lakh to the bodybuilder for his cause, he said. \"Since I do not have money, I am not in a position to procure the standard nutritional diet. But I am ready to fight all odds and I will manage to make it through. I will continue with my rigorous practice and give my best at both the competitions,\" he added."}

In Trichy, the desire for remarriage is growing among widowers. However, very few widows who are HIV positive want to remarry. According to statistics from the district administration, there are 11,097 people including 6,654 males and 4,443 females who are HIV positive. Most of the women are said to have received the killer syndrome from their husbands. With a view to finding a suitable life partner for both men and women patients, two marriage information bureaus exclusively for HIV people have been functioning in Trichy for the past six years. The marriage bureaus neither encourage nor discourage marriage. They simply explain to them the merits and demerits of marriage and let the parties decide. On the other hand, the counsellors believe that such marriages might prevent HIV positive men from spreading the virus through affairs. The two marriage bureaus have so far received about 250 applications seeking life partners. Interestingly, most of the applicants are widowers between 30 and 50. However, the number of widow applicants are nearly 50. Since there is a possibility that babies born to such couples will become HIV-affected, the marriage bureaus counsel the pairs to have safe sex to avoid having children. But the couples seemingly want to have children. The HIV-affected men want to get married for various social and personal reasons. \"The decision to remarry involves many reasons. First, many widowers do not want to expose themselves by being alone. So, they want to marry to hide their disease. Some of them are forced by their families to get married. There are many persons who want to enter wedlock for marital consummation. Interestingly, a 50-year-old man has now applied for remarriage. Since 2008, we received 39 applications from men and five applications from women. But only 12 marriages have taken place so far and seven children have been born through such marriages. All the children tested HIV negative,\" said A Thamil, a HIV positive person who runs Network for Positive People in Trichy. Thamil also said, \"Most women are affected by HIV because of their husbands. Many of them have begotten children through their marriage. Unfortunately, the sudden deaths of their husbands put the future of both mother and child at risk. Nevertheless, they do not want to think of remarriage because they do not want to lead a volatile life.\""}

He said it is high time the social stigma associated with AIDS and transgender population is removed. \u201cWe were initially fighting for our own Pehchaan (identity). In the meantime, we came to know that many eunuchs and others from the transgender population are getting infected with HIV and AIDS in large numbers.

However, for the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS), this was the best time to organize 10-day health camps, with HIV testing facilities, in districts which see a large population migrating to bigger cities for work. The results of the tests were an eye opener as high prevalence of HIV infection was found among the migrating population. The health department officials were shocked to find that the wives of these workers, many of them pregnant, also tested HIV positive. At least 65 cases of HIV were detected at the health camps set up in nine districts between November 1 and November 10. These districts were Ajmer, Bhilwara, Bikaner, Sriganganagar, Jodhpur, Nagaur, Pali, Sikar and Udaipur. Those who tested positive for HIV were unaware that they were being infected with the virus, which once again stresses on the need for strengthening HIV surveillance in the districts. Project director (AIDS) Dr JP Dhamija said, \"It was the best time for launching the HIV testing in nine districts as large number of out-migratory people return to their homes to celebrate Diwali. We did not force them for HIV testing but they voluntarily came at the health camps organized in the respective areas. The camps were successful as we tested 15,975 persons for HIV.\" Several pregnant women were found to be infected with HIV virus. In Sikar district, a pregnant woman was immediately referred to a hospital to prevent transmission of virus to the fetus. Two more pregnant women tested positive for HIV in Nagaur."}

HIV-related travel restrictions at present exist in 45 countries. The Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 report, released by UNAIDS on Tuesday, says that the effects of such restrictions are severe for migrant workers, who play an increasingly prominent role in the global economy. There is a blanket ban on entry of people living with HIV in five countries \u2014 Brunei Darussalam, Oman, Sudan, the UAE and Yemen. Five other countries \u2014 Egypt, Singapore, Iraq, Qatar and Turks and Caicos Islands \u2014 require individuals wishing to stay for short periods (10\u201390 days) to prove that they are HIV-negative. Laws in 20 countries, including Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Jordan and Kuwait, deport individuals discovered to be living with HIV. Even in the epidemic's fourth decade globally, nearly four in 10 countries worldwide still lack any specific legal provisions to prevent or address HIV-related discrimination. The number of international migrants rose from 191 million to 214 million between 2005 and 2010. The report says that the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) \u2013 Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE \u2013 all mandatorily test people seeking to come to the Gulf countries to work and require them to be periodically tested to renew visas. \"Those who become HIV-positive while working in the Gulf are often quarantined, deported, denied appropriate health care and ostracized upon returning to their home countries. Migrants' HIV-positive test results are shared with all approved by the medical centres in the Gulf Cooperation Council, with such workers categorized as \"permanently unfit\" to enter any Gulf Cooperation Council country in the future,\" the report said. India lifted all travel restrictions against HIV-positive patients in 2010. In 2002, the Union health ministry had issued a notification, stating that mandatory test for HIV for India-bound foreign nationals should be removed from visa forms. However, some embassies failed to enforce it, and continued to display the requirement of HIV test certificate on their websites as well as on visa forms. On September 17, 2010, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) clarified that there are no travel or residency restrictions for People Living with HIV (PLHIV) coming to India. UNAIDS says that most of these restrictions were imposed in the early years of the epidemic, when little was understood about HIV prevention and effective HIV treatment did not exist. \"In 2012, governments increasingly recognize that these restrictions make no sense in a world in which HIV exists in every country, people living with HIV are living long and productive lives and equal freedom of movement is not only a human right but essential in a globalized world. Of note is the decline in the number of countries, territories and areas with HIV-related travel restrictions from 96 in 2000 to 45 in 2012,\" UNAIDS said. UNAIDS aims to eliminate these restrictions by 2015. Since 2010, Armenia, China, Fiji, Namibia, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and the US have repealed such restrictions. Where such restrictions continue to exist, other forms of HIV stigma and discrimination are usually common. The World Health Organization (WHO) pointed out that such entry restrictions mount pressure on people into concealing their HIV infection from immigration authorities. \"They simply do not carry their HIV medicines on international trips. This could lead to drug-resistant HIV strains that are transmissible to other people. Besides, drug resistance allows HIV to replicate in the body more freely, people with higher viral loads are also more infectious,\" WHO said."}

But even then last year alone, 1.7 million people died from AIDS-related causes worldwide. Globally, 2.5 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2011. Half of all reductions in new HIV infections in the last two years have been among newborn children showing that elimination of new infections in children is possible. In 2011, there were 34 million people living with HIV. In South and south-east Asia, an estimated 4 million people were living with HIV in 2011, compared to 3.7 million in 2001. The same year, new infections in children were 43% lower than in 2003, and 24% lower than 2009. However, 72% of children living with HIV do not have any access to treatment. An estimated 6.8 million people are eligible for treatment, but don't have access. These are the findings of the Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 report released by UNAIDS on Tuesday. The number of people accessing HIV treatment has increased by 63% between 2009 and 2011. In India, however, around 60% people requiring treatment are getting it. \"The pace of progress is quickening \u2014 what used to take a decade is now being achieved in 24 months,\" said Michel Sidib\u00e9, executive director of UNAIDS. \"We are scaling up faster and smarter than ever before. It is the proof that with political will and follow through we can reach our shared goals by 2015,\" he said. Gains have been made in reducing tuberculosis (TB)-related AIDS deaths in people living with HIV. In the last 24 months, a 13% decrease in TB-related AIDS deaths was observed. This accomplishment is due to record number of people with HIV/TB co-infection accessing antiretroviral treatment, which is recorded at 45%. UNAIDS also estimates that an additional 4 million discordant couples (where one partner is living with HIV) would benefit from HIV treatment to protect their partners from HIV infection. Of the 34 million people living with HIV, about half do not know their HIV status. The report states that if more people knew their status, they could come forward for HIV services. For example, South Africa increased its scale up of HIV treatment by 75% in the last two years\u2014ensuring 1.7 million people had access to the lifesaving treatment\u2014and new HIV infections have fallen by more than 50,000 in only two years. The report shows that a more than 50% reduction in the rate of new HIV infections has been achieved across 25 low and middle-income countries \u2013\u2013 more than half in Africa, the region most affected by HIV. In some of the countries which have the highest HIV prevalence in the world, rates of new HIV infections have been cut dramatically since 2001 \u2014 by 73% in Malawi, Botswana (71%), Namibia (68%), Zambia (58%), Zimbabwe (50%), South Africa and Swaziland (41%). In addition to welcome results in HIV prevention, sub-Saharan Africa has reduced AIDS-related deaths by one-third in the last six years and increased the number of people on antiretroviral treatment by 59% in the last two years alone. The area where perhaps most progress is being made is in reducing new HIV infections in children. Half of the global reductions in new HIV infections in the last two years have been among newborn children. \"It is becoming evident that achieving zero new HIV infections in children is possible,\" said Sidib\u00e9. \"I am excited that far fewer babies are being born with HIV. We are moving from despair to hope,\" he added. The report shows that antiretroviral therapy has emerged as a powerful force for saving lives. In the last 24 months the numbers of people accessing treatment has increased by 63% globally. In sub-Saharan Africa, a record 2.3 million people had access to treatment. China has increased the number of people on HIV treatment by nearly 50% in the last year alone. There were more than half a million fewer deaths in 2011 than in 2005. The largest drops in AIDS-related deaths are being seen in countries where HIV has the strongest grip. South Africa saw (100,000) fewer deaths, Zimbabwe (nearly 90,000), Kenya (71,000) and Ethiopia (48,000) than in 2005."}

The Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) made the figures public in the wake of World Aids Day on December 1. There has also been a visible difference in the number of people suffering from AIDS, the most advanced stage of HIV when the infection becomes life threatening. This year, 416 have got AIDS as opposed to 790 last year. Experts say the city has come a long way from 2004 when there was a jump in the figures with nearly 278 deaths. However, the state figures still paint a grim picture about the lurking danger of HIV given that as 1,243 lives were lost to the deadly virus till October this year. Though there is a decline in the number of casualties as compared to last year, AIDS clearly claimed more lives in the state than malaria, dengue and H1N1 put together. For the city though, there has been a decline even in the number of fresh cases. This year 9,973 people have tested positive for HIV as compared to 12,944 cases in 2011. Though the difference in dip may be less than 1% between the two years, it has surely halved as compared to the situation five years back. In the past three years, over 2 lakh people have been walked into the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) out of which 5-8% have tested positive for HIV. This year too, out of 2.01 lakh Mumbaikars who got tested, around 5% were positive. MDACS additional project director Dr Balkrishna Adsul attributed the dip in positive cases and deaths to better awareness among citizens and integrated approach by agencies. \"We are now aiming towards zero positive cases and deaths,\" he said. Adsul said most of those who tested positive are in the 20-30 years agegroup. The MDACS figures also show a trend where more pregnant women are approaching the ICTC centres for testing and counselling. This year, 1.03 lakh pregnant women got tested for HIV out of which 365 tested positive. But, on the positive side, more children also seem to be getting Nevirapine, drug administered to babies born of HIV positive moms, soon after birth. Officially, the numbers say that 88.9% babies have received the drug that reduces their chances of getting HIV from 30% to around 12-15%. An expert, however, maintained that unregistered deliveries still remain a grey area. While, agencies fighting HIV/AIDS are rejoicing with Mumbai, still regarded as the epicentre, gaining significantly over the disease, experts have a words of caution. One of the experts told TOI, \"Fresh infections have been coming down in the general population for a while now but what about high-risk groups like female sex workers, men having sex with men (MSM), truckers and other vulnerable groups. Those numbers would also be crucial.\""}

I have helped nearly half-a-dozen HIV positive couples to tie the knot,\" Dr V.P Pandey, professor, department of medicine, Maharaja Yeshwantrao Hospital said. \"It is affection towards the partner which leads to marriage in such cases. One of my patients, a positive girl wanted to take the plunge despite knowing that she cannot have a baby. She didn't deter from her decision and said that nearly 15% of population does not have their own kid. She was confident that she could one or get one through IVF treatment,\" said Dr Pandey. According to the doctors, HIV positive couples have fair chances of having a normal child. With the medical treatments available and technological advancement, having a HIV negative child is possible. \"In past 7-8 years there are such medicines available, which make it possible to have a normal baby. I have seen nearly 100 couples having a normal baby in past 7-8 years,\" Dr Pandey said. The number of people getting married despite knowing they are HIV positive is even higher with the AIDS Society of India. Dr I.S Gilada, president of the society said, \"Those who are aware and know that HIV is manageable and allows for a good life expectancy through treatments do not fear about getting married. They want to live life as a normal individual and do anything for their affectionate partner.\" He further added that he has arranged marriages of 19 positive couples and 50 marriages of at least one partner who is HIV positive."}

Days after TOI reported how 45 countries \u2014 many of them major hubs for international business -- still ban travel of HIV infected patients, more than 40 CEOs who represent nearly 2 million employees from companies like Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, Pfizer, Heineken, Merck, the National Basketball Association and Thomson Reuters signed an unprecedented pledge urging the repeal of laws and policies in these countries that restrict movement of HIV positive patients. The CEOs said they opposed HIV travel restrictions because they were discriminatory and because to succeed in today\u2019s globalized economy, companies must be able to send their employees and best talent overseas, regardless of their HIV status. \u201cIt\u2019s time to send HIV travel restrictions packing,\u201d said Kenneth Cole, CEO of Kenneth Cole Productions. \u201cUsing our collective might, I believe we can use our influence to eliminate these discriminatory practices.\u201d The US lifted its 22-year HIV travel ban in 2010. Other countries, including Armenia, China, Fiji, Moldova, Namibia and Ukraine have also recently removed such restrictions. \u201cTravel restrictions on individuals with HIV are unnecessary and hinder the ability for individuals and companies to operate in a truly global workforce,\u201d said Mark Bertolini, chairman and CEO of Aetna. Most HIV-travel restrictions were imposed by governments in the 1980s when little was known about the transmission of HIV, and treatment didn\u2019t exist. \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve learned how to effectively prevent, manage and treat HIV,\u201d UNAIDS said. \u201cRestrictions on entry, stay and residence for people living with HIV are discriminatory and a violation of human rights,\u201d said Michel Sidib\u00e9, executive director of UNAIDS. \u201cEvery individual should have equal access to freedom of movement. I urge all countries to remove all such restrictions based on HIV status,\u201d he added. \u201cHIV travel restrictions are discriminatory and bad for business,\u201d said Chip Bergh, president of Levi Strauss & Co. There is a blanket ban on entry of people living with HIV in five countries \u2014 Brunei Darussalam, Oman, Sudan, UAE and Yemen. Five countries -- Egypt, Singapore, Iraq, Qatar and Turks and Caicos Islands -- require individuals wishing to stay for short periods (10\u201390 days) to prove that they are HIV-negative. Laws in 20 countries including Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, Jordan and Kuwait deport individuals discovered to be living with HIV. Even in the epidemic\u2019s fourth decade globally, nearly 4 in 10 countries worldwide still lack any specific legal provisions to prevent or address HIV-related discrimination. The Global AIDS Epidemic 2012 report, released by UNAIDS, says that the effects of such restrictions are most severe for migrant workers, who play an increasingly prominent role in the global economy. From 2005 to 2010, the number of international migrants rose from 191 million to 214 million. The report says that the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council \u2013 Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE \u2013 all mandatorily test people seeking to come to the Gulf countries to work and require them to be periodically tested to renew visas. \u201cThose who become HIV-positive while working in the Gulf are often quarantined, deported, denied appropriate health care and ostracized upon returning to their home countries. Migrants\u2019 HIV-positive test results are shared with all approved medical centres in the Gulf Cooperation Council, with such workers categorized as permanently unfit to enter any Gulf Cooperation Council country in the future,\u201d the report said. India lifted all travel restrictions against HIV-positive patients in 2010. In 2002, the health ministry had issued a notification stating that mandatory test for HIV for India-bound foreign nationals should be removed from visa forms. However, some embassies failed to enforce it and continued to display the requirement of HIV test certificate on their websites as well as on visa forms. On September 17, 2010 the ministry of external affairs clarified that there were no travel or residency restrictions for people living with HIV coming to India."}

There has been a 57% reduction in new HIV infections in India during the last decade with HIV prevalence among adults (15-49 years) dipping to 0.27% (2011) compared to 0.33% (2007). The total number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in India is estimated at 21 lakhs last year. Children (below 15 years) account for 7% of all infections, and 86% are in the 15-49 age bracket. Worryingly, of all the HIV infections, 39% (8.16 lakhs) are among women, most of whom being housewives. The new HIV estimated released by Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on Friday \u2013 on the eve of the World AIDS Day \u2014 says that around 1.16 lakh new HIV infections among adults and around 14,500 new infections among children had occurred last year. Of the 1.16 lakh estimated new infections in 2011 among adults, the six high-prevalence states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur and Nagaland accounted for 31% of new infections. Considerable declines in HIV prevalence have been recorded among female sex workers at national level (5.06% in 2007 to 2.67% in 2011) and in most of the states, where long-standing targeted interventions have focused on behaviour change and increase in condom use. Declines have been achieved among men who have sex with men (7.41% in 2007 to 4.43% in 2011) also, though several pockets in the country show higher HIV prevalence among them with mixed results. Reduction in HIV cases among Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) at the national level haven\u2019t been significant (7.23% in 2007 to 7.14% in 2011). Besides north-eastern states where declines have been achieved, newer pockets of high HIV prevalence among IDUs have emerged over the last few years, mainly in states like Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai, Kerala, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The report says that scale up of free anti retroviral treatment (ART) since 2004 has saved over 1.5 lakh lives till last year. At the current pace of scale up of ART services, it is estimated to avert around 50,000\u201360,000 deaths annually in the next five years. Azad told TOI, \u201cIndia\u2019s progress in controlling the deadly virus has been remarkable. China, India and South Africa are the only three countries which have witnessed a fall in new HIV cases by over 50%. The recent UN general assembly on HIV unanimously hailed these countries for such progress.\u201d In 2011, among the states, Manipur has shown the highest estimated adult HIV prevalence of 1.22%, followed by Andhra Pradesh (0.75%), Mizoram (0.74%), Nagaland (0.73%), Karnataka (0.52%), Goa (0.43%) and Maharashtra (0.42%). Besides these, Odisha, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Chandigarh have shown estimated adult HIV prevalence greater than the national prevalence at 0.27%. The study said, \u201cThe adult HIV prevalence at national level has continued its steady decline from estimated level of 0.41% in 2001 through 0.35% in 2006 to 0.27% in 2011. Similar consistent declines are noted among both males and females at national level.\u201d About 1.48 lakh people died of AIDS-related causes in India last year. Deaths among HIV infected children account for 7% of all AIDS-related deaths. Wider access to ART has led to 29% reduction in estimated annual AIDS-related deaths during NACP-III period (2007-2011). Thanks to fall in India\u2019s HIV numbers, south-east Asia (11 countries, including India) has seen a 35% dip in new HIV infections, from 3.2 lakhs (2001) to 2.08 lakhs (2011). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the HIV epidemic is clearly reversing. In 2011, 2.2 million people across the world were infected with HIV and 1.7 million died, half a million fewer new infections than 10 years ago, and 6 lakhs fewer deaths than 2005. However, the global health watch dog said the region also faces serious challenges. In the region, 46% of adults in need of treatment were enrolled in care and treatment by the end of 2011 \u2013 up from 12% in 2005. The coverage for HIV treatment in children is 39% in 2011 \u2013 up from 9% in 2005. Starting treatment early reduces morbidity and mortality due to HIV, and recent studies have also confirmed the prevention benefits of early treatment in uninfected regular sexual partners of HIV-infected individuals. \u201cThe overall decline in the region is cause for increased optimism, however complacency now could become our greatest enemy,\u201d said Dr Samlee Plianbangchang, regional director of WHO south-east Asia. \u201cThose most vulnerable to HIV are also among the least empowered and HIV prevention care and treatment services for these people need to be made available and accessible,\u201d he added."}

Statistics of the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) show 14 persons contracted the virus up to October this year as against four persons in the corresponding period last year; a rise of over 300%. The state's apex body for control of HIV/AIDS in Goa, incidentally, doesn't receive data of blood tests done at private laboratories, so the numbers-including the overall for the state-could be higher, said officials. The only other taluka to see a rise in HIV numbers this year is Ponda-two up from 26 recorded last year. Most of the other 11 talukas have seen declines. Commenting on Canacona's rise in numbers, GSACS project director Dr Rajananda Desai said the tourist-centric beaches in the taluka-Palolem and Galgibaga-could have contributed to the overall numbers. The coastal belts of the state have always been considered very vulnerable to the virus. Remarkable declines in numbers were recorded in Salcete (52; down 34 from last year's 86), Mormugao (77; down 37 from last year's 114), Tiswadi (33; down 26 from 59), Quepem (10; down nine from 19) and Pernem (4; down seven from 11). Dips were also seen in Bicholim (14; down four from last year's 18), Sanguem (12; down four from 16) and Sattari (14; down one from 15). GSACS' statistics also show an increase in the number of those who succumbed to full-blown AIDS this year. Eighty-one persons-57 men, 23 women and a transgender person-succumbed to AIDS between January and September 2012 as against 90 who died between January and December 2011. Commenting on this, Desai said, \"HIV takes several years to turn into full-blown AIDS. Those who died would have contracted the virus seven to eight years ago.\" She added that up to October this year 486 people have tested positive for HIV, while 76 are currently living with AIDS. Desai stressed that HIV cases have been on a decline in Goa for the last four years. While around 1,019 persons contracted the virus in 2008, the numbers dropped to 959 in 2009, 821 in 2010 and 665 in 2011. Of these 105 HIV-infected persons developed AIDS in 2008, 184 in 2009, 154 in 2010 and 106 in 2011. Stating that GSACS has so far tested the blood samples of just 3,62,414 people for HIV (the state's population is over 15 lakh), the project director said there could be more people with HIV in Goa. \"We work with high-risk groups that include commercial sex workers, and men who have sex with men. While most have tested for the virus, there may be some who have not come forward to test themselves,\" said Desai. She added, \"Besides, there may be some people who have done their blood tests at private laboratories. These laboratories do not provide their data to GSACS and their figures are therefore not on record.\""}

The data shows 1,012 patients were added to the HIV list in Gujarat as reported by government and NGO-run dispensaries. A total of 25,885 patients are undergoing ART in the state. Further, the number of children and adults undergoing ART doubled between January 2010 and 2012. Gujarat State Aids Control Society (GSACS) officials said this was because of increased surveillance and more nodal centres.

The new HIV estimates released by Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on the eve of World AIDS Day show Maharashtra remains a hotbed for HIV infection among high-risk groups and the prevalence rate is much higher than the national average. According to the recently concluded HIV Sentinel Surveillance 2010-11, national prevalence among adults (15-49 years) dipped to 0.27% but the positivity in the state hovered around 0.42%. In fact, Maharashtra, with six other states, accounted for 31% new infections in the two years since the previous study. Agencies working for HIV prevention in the state attributed the high prevalence to migration. Project director of Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) Ramesh Devkar said: \u201cWhile more people are approaching care centres, migration is one of the main causes why we continue to remain a hotbed.\u201d The state has come off as the worst for HIV among female sex workers (FSW) with prevalence at 6.89% against a national average of 2.67%. Devkar pointed out that prevalence was around 11% two years ago, arguing that the state is improving. His biggest worry remains HIV prevalence among men having sex with men (MSM) and intravenous drug users (IDU). The national average for MSM is 4.43% but it\u2019s almost a steep 10% in the state. Experts say Mumbai plays a huge role. Though there is no official confirmation, the prevalence of HIV among MSM in the city is believed to be above 12%. Worse, among transgenders, the prevalence stands at an astounding 18.80%. For intravenous drug users, the state average for HIV/AIDS prevalence stood at 14.17%, double the national average of 7.14%. Overall, reduction in HIV cases among IDUs at the national level has not been significant. It has dipped from 7.23% in 2007 to 7.14% in 2011. In the HSS study, Mumbai surprisingly emerged as one of the areas with high prevalence of HIV among truckers. While Gujarat\u2019s Kutch topped the list with 8.1% prevalence, Mumbai appeared among the hotspots with an average of 1.2%, along with Nagpur 2% from the state. The total number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in India is estimated at 21 lakh last year with the state accounting for over 4.20 lakh cases. Around 1,243 people have succumbed to AIDS in the state this year till October."}

India\u2019s soon-to-be-announced fourth HIV/AIDS policy may entail the closure of 350 community care centres where patients get free hospitalization and medication. The government logic is that public hospitals have gathered enough expertise over the years to treat AIDS patients, but the HIV-positive community isn\u2019t convinced. The uncertainty isn\u2019t confined to the community centres alone. Virtually every aspect of HIV care and funding is in a state of flux over shrinking AIDS funding from global donors such as the Gates Foundation, DFID and Global Fund (see box). The Gates Foundation, for instance, brought in $338 million (equivalent to Rs 1,842 crore) since 2003 but it is in the process of exiting the country. Foreign funding accounted for over 90% of HIV budgets between 2002 and 2007, but it has shrunk to 30% since. By 2014, when most donors would have exited, the Indian government\u2019s National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco) will have to provide almost the entire budget. For many experts working in the field, this exit is fraught with challenges. Sanghamitra Iyengar of Samraksha, a Bangalore-based NGO, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good to integrate HIV care (that was previously available at care centres) into the public health system. But are India\u2019s hospitals ready for this yet?\u201d Her point is that a HIV-positive sex worker who gets diarrhoea would find it difficult to get a bed in an already overcrowded public hospital. A Delhi-based NGO official added: \u201cCan the government ensure there will be no stigma towards these patients? Moreover, many patients need palliative care or pain relief towards the end of life. Will they get it in the public health set-up?\u201d Seema Sayyed of Aastha Parivaar, which represents 30,000 commercial sex workers, fears that the government takeover would dilute the importance given to HIV/AIDS. \u201cHIV will be clubbed with other diseases such as diabetes,\u201d she said. Prof Shankar Das from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences said resource crises are in the offing. \u201cThe ongoing antiretroviral treatment programme may get adversely affected along with the prevention, care and support programmes,\u201d he said. But government officials assure they are prepared for the exit. Naco additional secretary Shyama Prasad said no final decision had been taken on how to implement the fourth HIV/AIDS programme. \u201cThere have been discussions, but no concrete announcements yet. There is a possibility that global funders will extend their financial commitment,\u201d he added. Syeda Hameed, member of the Planning Commission, clarified that there would be no gaps in funding as the government would take over from where the foreign agencies leave. The Planning Commission has time and again mentioned that India would be able to raise adequate funds for its healthcare programmes without donor help."}

Within AP, Kadapa tops the chart owing to the widespread HIV prevalence among pregnant women and is closely followed by East Godavari, Karimnagar, Guntur, Krishna and Mahbubnagar districts. In Hyderabad, the prevalence rate is around 0.75%, which is only marginally lesser than the state average of 0.77%, statistics revealed. While officials of AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS) maintain that the number of new infections reported from the state has dropped from 25,749 in 2008 to 23,905 in 2009, they say that AP still has a long way to go before it can weed out the issue and see a significant decline in HIV cases. Among High Risk Groups (HRGs) too, doctors indicate, the HIV rate has seen a considerable drop. Between 2006 and 2009, the number of people infected have come down by an approximate 23%. According to recent statistics, currently the prevalence rate is 7.1% among female sex workers, 10.1% among men having sex with men, 3% among injectable drug users and 3.2% among long distance truckers. \"AP has been disproportionately impacted by HIV/Aids epidemic as one-fifth of the estimated PLHAs in the country are from here,\" said Dr Jaya Krishna, state epidemiologist, APSACS, which has 4.02 lakh HIV positive cases registered with it.

But while most AIDS patients see death staring at them, this gutsy 40-year-old woman and her 15-year-old son have refused to let the demon run havoc in their life. Aruna Sarkar's husband Sujoy committed suicide in 1999, unable to come to terms with the fact that he was HIV positive. By then he had already passed on the virus to Aruna and the couple's only son Debaditya. On World AIDS day the mother-son duo prays that no one in this world gets infected for no fault of theirs. Everything looked rosy for Aruna and Sujoy when they tied the knot in 1996. A few months later Sujoy left for Mumbai to work as radio officer with an oil major. He would come back to stay with his family in their Salt Lake house during leaves. It was during such trips home that his family noticed him falling ill often. Though Sujoy had got his HIV status detected in Mumbai, he did not dare share it with any of his family members, not even his wife. \"My husband probably could not accept that fact that he had the virus. In addition the guilt that he might have infected me and my son probably led him to commit suicide in July 1999. My son was a little less than two years then,\" Aruna recounted. There was worse to come. Sujoy's parents blamed Aruna for his HIV status and consequent suicide. She and the toddler were thrown out of the house. With advice from doctors, the mother-son got themselves checked and found that they were both infected. Since then they have been living with Aruna's parents in Baguiati. \"My world came crumbling down for the second time when we both tested positive for HIV. My son became really ill in 2004. But Dr Subhashis Bhattacharya, who works at the apex clinic in Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, came as a godsend. He not only helped us with the treatment but supported us mentally through counseling. He made us believe that AIDS is not the end of the world,\" Aruna told TOI. Aruna's elder brother and parents stood rock solid behind her. Aruna, who is a science graduate, gives private tuition to fund his son's education. Debaditya is preparing for his Class X board examination. \"I am very positive about life. Come what may, I do not let HIV affect my life. But I do not want my friends to come to know about it as the infection is still a taboo for many. I only wish no one gets the infection for none of their fault,\" Debaditya said. \"The amount of grit and courage Aruna has is incredible. In spite of being HIV-positive, she is not only bringing up her HIV-positive son single-handedly, but is also ensuring good education for him,\" said Dr Bhattacharya, a paediatric HIV specialist with NACO. Aruna and Debaditya are getting their anti-retroviral therapy free of cost, but she is concerned for her son's future. Often she has to seek financial help from NGOs for his education. \"The expenses of my son's education will only grow as he graduates into higher class. My earning through private tuitions is too meagre and irregular at times. I want a job but I do not know who would offer me one. Also will any organisation give me a job if they know my HIV status?\" wondered Aruna. While teaching the chapter on HIV in biology Aruna does not forget to tell her students never to indulge in unprotected sex. \"I make it a point to stress upon the fact that none should have unprotected sex as it is a major source for HIV transmission. I do not want anyone to undergo the hardship I am going through. I can fight but not everyone might have the strength to do so,\" she added.

The mom-to-be, who hails from the Old Town area, discovered to her horror that she had tested positive for HIV/AIDS. What unfolded thereafter was nothing short of a tragedy. The child she gave birth to was born HIV positive and died within weeks of birth. Her husband Raju (name changed), whom she married in 2008 and was one who allegedly passed on the infection to her, died a few months ago because of infections generally associated with the disease. Now Sujatha's family members have lodged a police complaint with the One Town police station against Raju's family, alleging that he deliberately hid his HIV status at the time of marriage and infected an innocent woman. They are demanding that Raju's family bear the cost of Sujata's treatment, as she hails from a not so well-to-do family. \"She is on ARV (anti-retroviral drugs) and her monthly medicine bill alone comes to about Rs 3000. The drugs along with other medicines and nutritional food are very costly. She was infected by her husband and now it is their turn to take care of her,\" her mother Savitri said. Similar cases of persons getting married without disclosing his or her health status are on the rise. Recently, another such case came to light in a very well-known and affluent family. Luckily the bride's parents came to know about the groom's HIV positive status on the wedding morning and demanded he undergo a medical test due to which he was caught, says Dr Kutikuppla Surya Rao, a doctor who has been treating HIV/AIDS affected since the last two decades. But most cases do not come to light due to the stigma attached to the disease. In fact, police officials at One Town station admitted that Sujata's was the first such case to be lodged with them. \"We are aware of such things and will not hesitate to book a case but most people do not come forward as stigma of being HIV/AIDS positive still prevails. Things can change only when people come out of their shell and lodge a complaint,\" said an official of One Town police station. For several years, this has been the subject of a raging debate - should both the bride and the groom be made to undergo HIV/AIDS test before marriage? \"This issue was first raised at a NACO summit chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2001. The discussion then moved to Parliament but never translated into an Act or rule. It has been watered down to the level that if an innocent woman or man is infected by his or her partner, then he or she can lodge a complaint in the police station or file a case for compensation or treatment charges. But that is not sufficient in the present condition,\" pointed out Dr Surya Rao. The medical practitioner says that such cases have been on the rise and he has seen about 30 to 40 such cases in the last two years. \"In a majority of the cases, it has been men infecting women, with just a few stray cases the other way around. And 80 per cent of them were aware of their HIV status. Being aware and then getting married is a crime. Though 2012 is considered to be a path breaking year for HIV/AIDS research as the treatment is moving from prevention phase to cure status, it is still a crime to infect another purposefully. There is, however, no problem if two positive persons get married,\" he said. Though as per a NACO report the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is on the decline, Dr G Prabhakar of Green Vision pointed out that the decline was being witnessed in high risk group such as commercial sex workers (CSWs), truckers and migrant workers. \"The worrying factor is that the growing promiscuity among youth has led to an upswing in the incidence of the disease in the middle and affluent classes. Though there is no survey to establish this fact, as a medical practitioner actively involved in this segment, I think there has been a growth of at least 10 per cent over the last decade,\" said Dr Prabhakar. Host of awareness programmes today On the occasion of World AIDS Day on Saturday, the Port City is hosting a number of awareness programmes in tune with this year's theme of 'Getting to zero'. As per the theme, the aim is to achieve zero figure in various areas such as - new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS related deaths' for period 2011-15. Addressing the media here on Friday, additional district medical health officer (AIDS and Leprosy) Ronanki Ramesh said that AP has around five lakh HIV positive persons, of which 5.78 per cent are from Vizag district alone. Kutikuppala Surya Rao, a medical practitioner, who had been treating the HIV/AIDS-infected and affected in the city, said the focus this time was on the student community to raise awareness levels as education plays a vital role in creating awareness. As part of this, a first of its kind human AIDS red ribbon chain would be formed at the campus of Government College for Women at 10 am on Saturday. Apart from this, a 40 feet high burning red ribbon would be displayed there. Meanwhile, the district medical, health and family welfare department in collaboration with the Greater Visakha Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is also organising a rally at 9 am from GVMC to Jagadamba on the occasion. Around 500 nursing students are expected to participate in the rally apart from female sex workers. \"A public meeting will also be held from 10.30 am and will be addressed by the district collector and chairman of district AIDS Prevention and Control Committee V Seshadri in the presence of GVMC commissioner,\" Ramesh said."}

The prevalence of HIV among pregnant women in the seven coastal districts combined is 0.81 per cent, which is more than the state average of 0.77 per cent. As per AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS) data, the highest prevalence of HIV among pregnant women is in Kadapa (2.25 %), followed by the coastal district of East Godavari (1.25 per cent). In Krishna (1 %), Guntur (1.08 %) and West Godavari it is close to the state average. Vizag, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam are however a little lower than the state average. Project director of APSACS C Partha Sarathi said, \"We have given special focus on prevention of new infections from pregnant women to newborns during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. The vertical (mother to child) transmission rate without any medication is around 30 per cent. During the last National Aids Control Programme (NACP), we were able to bring down this transmission rate to about 10 per cent with single dose Nevirapine prophylaxis in the mother-baby pairs. But AP is now piloting the superior triple drug regime, which aims at bringing down the HIV infection in newborns to around three per cent.\" Recently, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka launched the PPTCT (prevention of parent to child transmission) 'triple drug regimen'. \"There will be a paradigm shift with the triple-drug regimen. The state is now looking forward to bringing down the mother-to-child transmission to zero,\" said state epidemiologist K Jaya Krishna and deputy director (monitoring, evaluation and surveillance), APSACS. Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy), Visakhapatnam, said, \"Around 85 per cent of HIV transmission happens due to unsafe sex, while around 15 per cent is passed on from the pregnant mother to the child. It's now possible to stop vertical transmission by 98 per cent with the use of a combination of three ARV drugs starting from 14 weeks of pregnancy irrespective of CD4 count till the end of breastfeeding that is up to one or one and a half years. Soon after delivery, the infant will be given Nevarapine syrup for six weeks to be followed up for DBS-PCR tests till 18 months. The triple drug regimen under Mamta Plus programme also spikes the risk of drug resistance,\" he stated. AP is planning to give special importance to counselling and testing programme in the coming year and has set a target for 35 lakh tests (including 15 lakhs pregnant women). Overall, according to APSACS, new infections are on the decline in the state with an approximately 23 per cent decline in new infections being recorded in 2009 in comparison to 2006. ANC prevalence dropped down to less than 1% (0.77%) for the first time in 2010, as per the latest survey."}

Earlier, the HIV testing facilities were available at all government medical colleges, district hospitals and community heath centres of seven high risk districts. Now, RSACS has decided not to keep confine the HIV testing facilities at high risk districts but also to expand it to other districts as well. \"Rajasthan has a special situation in terms of equal HIV prevalence rates of both urban and rural areas,\" an RSACS official said. The official said already 182 Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTC) are in the state. However, majority of the ICTCs were located at seven districts - Jaipur, Ajmer, Alwar, Tonk, Udaipur, Barmar and Sriganganagar. Except in these seven districts, the other districts lack testing centres. The HIV testing in private hospitals is costly but at the government's centres, it is free of cost, the official said, adding that expanding the testing facility would strengthen healthcare facilities in the state. Apart from 182, another 282 more testing centres would be opened in the state with help from the staff of the community health centres (CHC). The RSACS would provide HIV testing kits to the CHCs. Trained counselors would be posted at the CHCs and would counsel people coming to the centre for HIV testing. For the purpose, the RSACS would provide training to National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) employees deployed at the CHCs. The RSACS data show that till January of the financial year 2010-11, altogether 1.92 lakh general clients were counseled, 1.87 lakh tested and 6,417 persons tested positive for the HIV. The new ICTC would impart information people about HIV prevention, counsels them to undergo testing, provides testing facilities and also links positive people with treatment, care and support system, the RSACS said. The society further said HIV testing facilities help in identifying new HIV positive cases and provide the new cases a quality of life by linking them with support and care."}

Haryana has already established one Anti-Retrovial Treatment Centre at PGIMS, Rohtak, and 16 Link Anti-Retrovial Treatment Centres in the districts for treatment of HIV and AIDS patients free of charge. Dr Vijay Kumar, in charge of district AIDS control department, said, \"The link ART centre will be opened in Delhi within two-three months. Doctors have already been trained for this purpose and HIV positive patients will be given medicines from here.\" On the eve of World AIDS Day, Haryana Chief Minister, Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that the theme of World AIDS Day was \"Getting to zero: Zero new HIV infections, Zero Discrimination, Zero AIDS-related deaths\" and the state government was committed to provide better treatment facilities to people living with HIV and AIDS and to keep a check on deaths caused by it. This year, 200 patients have been registered with the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) in Gurgaon. The first centre was opened at the Civil Hospital in 2002 in the district and at present there are six such centres in the district. In 2002, eight patients were registered, but gradually the number has increased over the years. Kumar said the main reason for this is awareness among people. Haryana health minister, Rao Narender Singh, said that to reduce the prevalence of HIV among drug injection users of Haryana, three new Opioid Substitution Therapy Centres and seven new targeted intervention (TI) projects would be started in the state. Singh said that three new Opioid Substitution Therapy Centres in Panipat, Faridabad and Bahadurgarh would be opened under the Harm Reduction Programme. Singh added that there was a downward trend in the number of HIV and AIDS patients among different categories in the state. The prevalence of HIV in pregnant women has decreased to 0.14% in 2012 as against 0.30% in 2006. Similarly, this percentage in general clients had fallen down to 1.64% as against 6.47% in 2006. The prevalence among female sex workers had also shown a decline from 1.19% to 0.58% whereas among injecting drug users it had reduced from 2% in 2008 to 1.01% in 2012."}

From February 2013, pregnant women tested positive for HIV will be given a combination of three antiretroviral drugs recommended by WHO for pregnant women with HIV/AIDS. \u201cThis will reduce the transmission rate to less than 1%,\u201d said AIDS control society project director Kumar Jayanth. TN, where the virus was first detected in the country in 1986, has led the fight agai- nst HIV/AIDS. Tamil Nadu once had one of largest number of HIV/AIDS cases in the country, but it has brought down incidence of infections to 0.3%, becoming a role model for other states in the country. The incidence of HIV is on the decline across India, but the state is working towards achieving the WHO international goal: \u201cGetting to zero: zero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS related deaths.\u201d \u201cThis cannot be possible unless we stop transmission from mother to child and make treatment accessible to pregnant women,\u201d Jayanth said. Women now get one dose of the antiretroviral therapy during labour. This prevents the mother passing on the virus to the baby. The baby gets a dose of the drug within 72 hours of delivery. However, studies by various institutions, including National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis, have found that 10% of babies of women with HIV/AIDS contract the virus even with this treatment. The research centre, the central testing HIV laboratory for newborns in TN, Pondicherry and Kerala, receives at least 1,200 samples every year. Of these at least 120 test positive for HIV. Experts point out that the testing process is flawed. \u201cThe lab first gets a drop of dry blood on a filter paper. If this tests positive, we repeat the test on fresh samples. But it takes an average of six months to it,\u201d said NIRT director Soumya Swaminathan. While tracking cases, Dr Swaminathan found that less than 25% of the children who tested positive for HIV had started treatment. \u201cThe other children were dead or could not be found,\u201d she said. The statistics are similar at the department of genetics in TN Dr MGR Medical University, which is the testing centre for Andhra Pradesh, says Dr S Mini Jacob, head of the varsity\u2019s department of experimental medicine. \u201cIt is proved that starting treatment for a pregnant women will stop transmission to the child,\u201d Dr Jacob said."}

In a country where people living with AIDS are still subjected to ostracism, a lone HIV positive woman with two children did not really stand a chance.

In Sangeeta\u2019s case, the gunny bags came with something even more precious \u2013 dignity.

Few hours into her stay at the government hospital, she not only had to fight AIDS, but the stigma attached to it. \"Discrimination is widespread, the nurse refused to give me an injection, fearing she would get infected,\" she said. Across the state, it will be hard to find hospitals that will do the operation or surgical procedure on AIDS victims or HIV positive persons, alleged Rajpal Shekhawat of Madhya Pradesh network people (MPNP), an organisation formed by AIDS affected victim and families. According to estimates, there are 28,548 adults (till Oct 2012) identified as HIV positive in Madhya Pradesh. The situation is even worse at the district level. It's been 6 months since 25-year-old Anand (named changed) has had a accumulation of water in his chest, after an accident. The local hospital refused to conduct an operation after they learnt Anand was HIV positive, said Shekhawat. Some of the AIDS victims do find care, but it comes at a hefty price. A 45-year-old woman from Alirajpur was operated upon in a private hospital in Indore. She required support plates for fracture repair. She paid the price for being the AIDS victim, said Shekhawat. Even if hospitals operate or admit AIDS patients for treatment, they face many inequalities. \"AIDS victims are told to get their own bed-sheets, plastic-mats and, at times, even drinking water glasses,\" he added. This year, the World AIDS Day theme is 'Getting to Zero'. \"Zero discrimination of AIDS patients by the medical fraternity is the least we want without which improved access to lifesaving drugs means nothing,\" said Shekhawat. 1,443 HIV+ kids in state According to Madhya Pradesh State AIDS control society, there are 1,443 HIV positive children in the state. \"World AIDS Day brings focus on HIV positive children, who are in need of care, support, treatment and protection,\" said UNICEF Madhya Pradesh office chief, Tania Goldner. \"It should be priority to make a difference to the lives of children infected and affected by HIV and also reduce stigma and discrimination, which HIV-affected children still face,\" she added."}

Given this year's theme of 'Getting to zero: zero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS related deaths,' it is dispiriting to see the increasing number of AIDS patients in the district. As per the HIV sentinel surveillance report in 2007 the prevalence of AIDS in Coimbatore was registered at 0.25 percent. In the subsequent year, it increased to 0.33 percent and by 2011 it was 0.94 percent. Regions in the district where prevalence is highest include Pollachi, Karamadai, Periyanaickenpalayam and Thondamuthur. Although the district has improved its position in state prevalence rankings from second position in 2006 to ninth position this year, the number of cases has seen an upward trend since 2007. Last year, 8,342 cases were registered in Coimbatore district. This included 4531 males, 3403 females and 25 transgenders. Pertaining to children, there were 195 boys and 188 girls found to be positive. However, Dr B Mohamed Ali, district programme manager, AIDS Prevention and Control Unit said that these numbers are arbitrary as they refer to only registered cases. \"The number of unregistered cases could be another 10,000,\" he said. M Saktivel, district tuberculosis officer said that one reason why the numbers are higher in Coimbatore district is because of the migrant labour coming into the district. \"This is a high risk group which continues to be susceptible to AIDS virus despite the several initiatives and awareness programmes conducted,\" he said. Meanwhile, in Tamil Nadu, the prevalence in 2003-2004 was 0.50 per cent. It dropped to 0.41 per cent in 2007-2008 and it is presently 0.38 per cent. Regarding rankings, Tamil Nadu stood 7th in the country during 2003-2004, improved to 10th position in 2007-2008 and now stands at 14th position in the country. However, Dr Mohamed said that when compared to 2006 where prevalence of AIDS was 2.49 per cent in Coimbatore district, the percentage has come down. He attributed the improvement to the several awareness programmes conducted by the district and measures implemented to curb incidence of the disease. \"The concept of Information, Education and Communication, part of the AIDS programme is taken to factories and industries and other high risk groups. TB patients are regularly tested for AIDS. The distribution of free condoms also helps,\" he said. Talking about recent initiatives taken by the department, Mohamed said that prisoners affected by AIDS are given nutritional supplements. Foods rich in protein, iron and carbohydrates are included in their menu. \"Earlier, eggs, milk and chicken were provided to these prisoners twice a week. However, it proved insufficient and thus we have included nutritional supplements in their diet,\" he said."}

The provision of concession was introduced by the state government so that the people living with HIV/AIDS would not have to spend on fares to get medicines for HIV/AIDS, which is being provided by the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society free of cost from the ART centers. However, many HIV/AIDS patients claimed they have to face problems in availing the concession. \"The bus conductor demands the pass issued by RSRTC.

In 1985, the first AIDS patient was detected in India. Quoting the figures issued by UP AIDS Control Society, he said 1,45,000 people are registered with anti-retro viral therapy (ART) centres. Priyadarshi said mainly because of blood transfusion, a person comes in contact with HIV. A total of 90-95% of people get affected with HIV due to blood transfusion. He added that HIV attacks CD 4 cells of the human body and weakens the immunity of the person. The person is unable to fight with the diseases and becomes seriously ill. World AIDS Day is being observed across the globe since 1988. The purpose of observing this day is to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS. Dr Kiran Pandey, HoD, gynecology, GSVM Medical College said fairer sex is more prone to HIV/AIDS due to the physical structure. Lack of awareness among women is a cause of spread of AIDS.

The city is emerging as a new ground for HIV infections caused by intravenous drug abuse. Director, centre of excellence, National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), Banaras Hindu University, Shyam Sundar said HIV infection is a common trend in north eastern states specially Manipur, but the trend is now seen in Varanasi as well. \u201cAt present around 10 HIV patients are being treated in the ART centre, BHU. They are not backpackers or foreigners but natives of the city, who are youngsters and middle-aged people. Such drug abusers are often seen at ghats and older parts of the city. Mass sharing of the syringe and needle is often a common practice by drug abusers that invites HIV infection. The trend is catching fast which is very unlikely for a city like Varanasi,\u201d Sunder added. The officials of NACO, Varanasi, stated that the entire eastern UP area is turning out to be a highly sensitive zone for HIV infections because of migration from rural to urban slum areas and even metropolitan cities. Jaunpur, Azamgarh and Ghazipur are identified as the highly sensitive districts. Varanasi ranks at number four. Most of these patients are in the age group of 20 to 45 years and bread winners for the families. Almost 90 per cent of the patients belong to lower middle class families and have poor economic conditions. Recently, new ART centres (for first line treatment) have been opened in Ghazipur, Azamgarh, Jaunpur and the district hospital in Varanasi but the region\u2019s vulnerability towards the HIV infection is not decreasing the number of patients at ART centre, BHU. Around 300 to 350 patients are arriving at the centre every day. NACO nodal centre in BHU is also the ART centre which was formed in 2005. Already emerged as centre of excellence along with only three other ART centres in northern India, it is providing qualitative first line and second line treatment for AIDS. Apart from screening and treatment of HIV patients, the centre boasts of other facilities like integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC), Suraksha Clinic (STD clinic) and counselling centre for prevention of parent to child transmission (PPCTC). \u201cAt present, as many as 15,819 HIV positive patients are registered in the centre. Earlier low turnout of HIV positive people coming for screening and treatment at the centre was troubling the experts, but now we are overcoming this problem by identifying people and arranging meeting with ICTC and other centres.

Ranjan, who is in jail since November 14, is said to have been arrested for demanding adequate allocation of drugs at the 10 antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres in the state. The demonstrators claimed that the ART centres lacked sufficient doctors. They accused the Bihar State AIDS Control Society (BSACS) of ill-treating the HIV positive people. There are around 12,000 people with AIDS in Bihar, while another 55,000 are HIV positive. The largest numbers of HIV positive people are in Patna district. There are 207 integrated counselling and testing centres where people are tested for HIV and counselled accordingly. Bihar has sought help from the Centre for making arrangements for HIV/AIDS tests at every health centre across the state. BNP+ members from UP, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan participated in the demonstration. Supreme Court lawyer Anand Grover termed the arrest of Ranjan a clear violation of fundamental rights to speech. \"Continued denial of basic medicines and services to HIV positive people is a denial of the fundamental rights to them,\" said Manoj Pardeshi from New Delhi. Secretary, BNP+, Raj Kumar Singh said not only doctors do not come to the ART centres, even basic paediatric medicines are not available for the children found HIV positive. Sunita from Muzaffarpur said she has to travel 35kms to the ART centre for drug. She complained that drug is available only after 4-5 days of her visit. \"How can I manage with this,\" she said. Naresh Yadav of International treatment preparedness coalition of India (ITPC-India), New Delhi, said Ranjan's arrest speaks of Emergency-like situation where the government wants to suppress all the dissenting voice.

So, they need to be put on the second line of ART treatment. \u201cWe keep telling patients at every visit not to miss medicines. But some of them do land up with first line failure and have to be put on second line. GMCH started this facility last year. The viral load in these patients is extremely high. We identify them, send them to Mumbai to assess viral load, and if they need second line ART, they are put on it immediately,\u201d said professor and head of medicine at GMCH Dr YB Bansod. Second line of ART is available at only five centres in the state, at the government medical colleges in Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Sangli. Till October this year, total 1,546 patients were on second line. City has second line ART centre at GMCH, where 144 patients; 124 men, 17 women and 3 children, are being treated. Patients say that lack of awareness, carelessness, casual attitude and poverty play a big role in the discontinuation of medicine, leading to second line treatment.

The idea was to spread the word that though getting to zero is a challenge, significant progress is underway. A string of functions like AIDS awareness campaign, exhibitions, poster making, slogan writing competitions, nukkar nataks, were held. Nodal Officer, DAPCU , Dr. OP Shahi said, the level of awareness has increased manifold and data shows undergoing the HIV test has increased and number of positive cases in the district among general population and high risk groups has decreased. As per the latest National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) report, a 57% drop has been recorded in number of new HIV infections in the country over the past decade. The NACO report, released by union health ministry, revealed that nearly 1.5 lakh lives were saved thanks to free ART medicines provided to HIV/AIDS patients. India has demonstrated an overall fall of 57% in estimated new HIV infections (among adult population) annually from 2.74 lakh in 2000 to 1.16 lakh in 2011, said the NACO report. Experts point out that in high prevalence states cases have fallen by 76% during the same period. Rise in number of cases has been noted in some states where prevalence was low so far, said the report. The HIV estimates in 2012 indicate a continuing overall fall in adult HIV prevalence, new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths in the country. The adult HIV prevalence at national level has continued to decline steadily from an estimated 0.41% in 2001 to 0.35% in 2006 to 0.27% in 2011. The estimated number of persons living with HIV was 20,88, 642 in 2011, the report said. It is estimated that about 1.48 lakh persons died of AIDS related causes in 2011 in the country. Deaths among HIV-infected children accounts for 7% of all AIDS-related deaths. It is estimated that around 1.16 lakh new HIV-positive cases among adults and around 14,500 among children were reported during 2011. Dr Shahi, pointed out that World AIDS Day gave an opportunity for individuals and communities to initiate action and ensure that human rights are protected and global targets for HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment were met. NACO has placed five UP districts, including Allahabad, Azamgarh, Deoria, Etawah and Banda under scanner after these districts were placed fell in the sensitive category in terms of migration of HIV/AIDS infected persons. UPSACS (UP State Aids Control Society) officials are carrying out an intensive drive to check the health status of migrants and identify their locations with an aim to offer them counseling and treatment as well as assistance. They are also conducting studies regarding migration pattern and prevalence of HIV. Dr Shahi said, \u201cWe have been offering care, support and treatment to HIV positive patients and are also making sincere effort to offer them all sorts of services. For new clients, prevention and treatment is being offered. Migrant labourers, truckers and MSM (men having sex with men) were being identified in the district as they were most responsible for and vulnerable to spread of the deadly disease. Efforts are also underway to identify them so that they could be offered best possible treatment and counselling. During surveys, it has come to notice that victims due to various reasons including social stigma, do not come forward and reel under depression, said Dr Shahi."}

Dr Chandrakant Ruparelia, senior technical adviser at the Jhpiego, an affiliate of Johns Hopkins University and HIV/Aids expert, advocated this method to reduce Aids-related deaths while speaking to TOI on the sidelines of the World Congress on Dilemmas in OBGY. \u201cAs per the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), guidelines even though HIV testing is a part of routine anti-natal care, every woman does have a right to refuse the testing and still continue to get pregnancy related treatment. If every positive woman adheres to the prescribed drug regime, the chances of infecting the baby are a mere 2%,\u201d he said. It is possible to live a near normal life if an HIV positive person adheres to the medication regime to an extent of 95%. Discontinuity results in resistance to drugs. Though there is a second line of ART treatment available, adhering to three drugs lifelong is the best solution for a HIV positive person. \u201cAdhering to first line of drugs is also important because viral load testing facility is available only at a very few places as it is expensive and patients avoid going to other places and follow the new line of treatment,\u201d Dr Ruparelia said.

From 23,905 infections reported during 2009, the number of new infections dipped to 16,603 during 2011, which is a rare good sign, but overall the caseload was still highest with 3.61 lakh to 4.88 lakh cases.

A total of 24 such medicines for HIV/AIDS treatment are available and 30 more are in the pipeline. Talking to TOI, Dr IS Gilada, president, AIDS Society of India, who had come to deliver a keynote address in a seminar organised by University Institute of Paramedical Sciences said, \"Here in India, we can get medicines for HIV/AIDS treatment costing between Rs 1,000 and 2,000 for a month. The medical treatment for HIV/AIDS costs Rs 5,000 a year while it costs around Rs 5 lakh in foreign countries. Indian pharmaceutical companies are manufacturing cheap but effective medicines for HIV/AIDS treatment and as a result of this our country is exporting the medicines to nearly 160 countries.\"He added that the pace of research on finding vaccine for HIV/AIDS is going on at a rapid pace in US, France, Germany, Japan and Sweden. He added that there is no preventive vaccine for HIV till date after it was detected in 1980s. He informed that there are 24 types of medicines available for treating HIV/AIDS and another 30 are in the pipeline. Anti Retro Treatment (ART) is the only available way to fight HIV/AIDS, he said. Dr Gilada claimed that it is not true that HIV patients die soon. They can live for even 20-25 years after coming in contact with HIV. I have several such patients at my place who were detected AIDS 20 years back and still they are alive.The highest number of AIDS patients are in Andhra Pradesh, followed by Karnataka and Maharashtra. States like Tamil Nadu, Manipur and Nagaland also feature in the top 10 states.He said that major cities of Uttar Pradesh like Kanpur, Allahabad, Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Basti, Gonda and Siddhartha Nagar have maximum number of HIV/AIDS affected people and the number is increasing but still UP is far behind other states. The maximum number of AIDS patient in the country are in the age bracket of 20-45 years. Dr Gilada said that in last 10-15 years, a lot of change has been noticed in people about HIV/AIDS. \"The red light area In Mumbai which used to be flooded almost a decade back, remains almost empty.

In, Kanpur, AIDS counselling and testing facilities literally do not exist in any of the CHCs and PHCs, except Bidhnoo CHC. This is the main reason why majority of AIDS patients go unidentified. There was an action plan proposed by the Central government in 2009, under which each state had been given a target to upgrade about 50% of the CHCs and PHCs under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) by March 2011. Under this upgradation, the community and primary health centres were to be upgraded as per the Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) in order to provide an optimal level of quality health care to the rural population. The HIV testing and AIDS counselling was also in the list of upgradation. But the scenario of the city is enough to show the success of the plan.

It was just due to some accident, they get to know that they are suffering from AIDS. Those who are a bit aware come for treatment while hundreds die every year. The only reason that HIV and AIDS counselling and testing is out of their reach,\u201d the official added. The official also gave the example of Etawah, where a large number of HIV and AIDS cases came into light in past two years. The reason is an increase in number of ICTC centres in the rural blocks. Etawah is a small place with very less population in comparison to that of Kanpur and Lucknow but around 50% of its health institutions are having ICTC centers. \"There is no denying that AIDS counselling and testing services are still defunct in many CHCs and PHCs in the city.

The minister told TOI \u201cin no way can India achieve such a target in the near future. In fact no country can do so.\u201d \u201cZero discrimination\u201d, according to him, is a far cry. On Friday, Azad told Parliament that discrimination is rampant in India. The minister said the operational guidelines for ART services clearly mention that \u201cirrespective of HIV status of a person, all patients are entitled to receive general and special out patient and inpatient services in a hospital.\u201d He added that \u201cconfidentiality should be maintained at all levels irrespective of HIV status as per medical ethics and the law.\u201d But he admitted that cases of discrimination \u201care reported from time to time\u201d.

Southern states have done better,\u201d said Azad. New HIV infections in children are down, but reaching the goal of an AIDS-free generation requires that more HIV+ pregnant women receive antiretroviral treatment to decrease the risk of infection for their babies, said Unicef on Saturday. In India over 14,000 children got infected last year \u2014 a 13% decline from 2009. The number of estimated deaths among children (0-14 age group) due to AIDS was 10,213 in 2011. The total number of people living with HIV in the country has seen a decline from approximately 2.3 million to 2.1 million.

Much progress has been made in the field of treatment. In low and middle-income countries, coverage of effective antiretroviral treatment for preventing mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) reached 57% in 2011,\u201d Unicef added. Regarding access to treatment of children in need, it increased from 6% in 2006, when the pediatric HIV programme was launched in India to 34% last year. \u201cIt is simply wrong that adults are twice as likely as children to receive the treatment they need,\u201d said Anthony Lake, executive director of Unicef. \u201cBy definition, an AIDS-free generation depends on protecting the youngest and most vulnerable from HIV infection. We must do still more to help mothers and children who live with HIV be able to live free from AIDS. We must rededicate ourselves to boosting the number of pregnant women and children being tested and treated through basic antenatal and child health programmes,\u201d he added."}

She was pregnant when she found out that her husband was HIV positive and had concealed the information from her. Betrayed, she came back. The bigger shock came when pregnancy tests revealed that her husband had passed the virus on to her. \"I had seen my husband remain ill all the time because of HIV. When I came to India, I consulted a doctor who put me on Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) right away and asked me to have a nutritious diet. I made it my mantra. Except for normal coughs and colds, which normal people suffer during changes of season, I have not remained ill,\" says Manisha. Manisha says her good health prompted her to start a beauty parlour in partnership with her best friend. \"I feel very energetic and have never felt sick. My attitude towards HIV has changed through my own experience\", says Manisha. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Atul Patel, who was one of the first private practitioners to dedicate himself to treating HIV, says viral load becomes undetectable in patients on ART therapy after just six months of treatment. \"With this treatment, only the diagnostic test tells if a person is HIV positive. Otherwise, viral load becomes undetectable in the blood,\" says Dr Patel. \"I have a number of patients who have been treated for the last 10 years and a few have lived for more than 12-14 years! My oldest patient is a 96-year old gentleman who has been living healthily with HIV for 12 years,\" says Dr Patel. He says that most patients who have done well have followed their treatments well, have paid attention to what they eat, and more importantly, have had good family support. \"Good family support somehow adds years and cuts down the illness\", says Dr Patel. Ahmedabad: When you first meet Manoj Parmar, 31, he appears healthy, with a wide, infectious smile. His story touches people deeply. Manoj has been battling HIV for nine years. He was diagnosed with the virus in 2003. Scared and shocked, he was left with no option but to keep this news to himself. After three years of struggle, in 2006, he came out and shared the news with his family. \"I was helpless and didn't know who to turn to for advice. Those three years were the hardest for me since there were no medicines available for treatment at that time,\" he says. His suffering motivated and inspired him to become a counselor in the Family Planning Association of India (FPAI). Now he counsels people suffering from HIV and AIDS. He is one of the few people who is an HIV patient as well as a HIV counsellor. \"The most vital aspect for an AIDS patient is that they should take great care that the disease does not spread to another person. My wife is also an HIV positive patient, but we take full preventive measures.\" In fact, the couple was living such a normal life that they felt confident adopting the girl child from their wife's first marriage. \"I am very lucky to get moral and emotional support from my family and friends. Their acceptance level has motivated me to live a normal life without any shame or guilt. I believe that my behavior is important, not status. Live till you die, is what I tell all my patients in my counseling sessions.\" \"Whether it's an accident or a deadly disease like AIDS, one should live life happily and healthily. Exercise regularly, do yoga, eat nutritious food and create a positive environment. Also emotional and mental support from those close to us is necessary to live a good, positive life. AIDS patients are just like normal people and one should not discriminate against them,\" he concludes."}

However, her world literally fell apart when after few months of marriage, her husband tested positive for HIV. Her fears of having been infected by her husband proved incorrect when she tested negative. Many thoughts, including deserting Abhinav, crossed her mind then but she was truly in love with him. In her own words the \"thought of letting a virus ruin her married life was just not correct\". Though she decided to stay with Abhinav, her dreams of having children were shattered as unprotected sex with her husband could not only put her at risk of contracting the disease but could also infect the child that she desperately wanted. The couple had given up all hopes till someone told them that it might be possible for them to have their child through the assisted in-vitro fertilization (IVF) reproduction technique. After consultations with city-based doctors the couple went ahead with IVF and is now expecting their first child in another two months. \"We are praying that the child is free from HIV\", they say. While they may have some doubts, the doctors who carried out the procedure on them are however confident that the child would be \"normal and healthy\". However, they refused to disclose the name of nursing home as such patients object on it. Dr Neeraj Pahalajani, a leading city-based practitioner, said that world over, more than 400 cases have been documented where couples, with HIV positive husbands, have successfully had children through IVF/IUI technique. \"We have also used the same technique on several couples and are sure that their child too would be healthy\", she says. Elaborating, Dr Pahalajani said, however in IVF- ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection) technique, the husband's semen, which carries the infection, is washed thoroughly using specific medical solutions and one single sperm is picked to fertilize the egg. The embryo is subsequently transferred into the mother's womb. But it is not 100% risk free. So they can also adopt other procedure of donor's sperm. Dr Pahalajani says with acceptance about HIV growing in the society, it is the responsibility of the medical fraternity to offer solutions to the HIV-infected couples to raise healthy families."}

According to Berlin Jose, founder-director of Russ Foundation, each of these children have a story of their own, but have successfully come out of their trauma and are doing well in the mainstream education system. Chittu for example was born to a female sex worker who made her income on the streets of Madurai. The woman who had a partner who was already married and had two children, was being used by him to make money. When she became sick and realized she was going to die of AIDS, she brought her three-year-old child, who was already begging on the streets of Madurai, to the home for adoption. She died a few days later. Her partner, however, who could not prove that he was the biological father of this child, was reluctant to give up the child because he had already chalked out plans to make money by making her beg. \"We went through a tough battle with him before the authorities handed her over to us,\" said Jose. Initially, the girl's stomach which was used to scavenging on food on the roadside, could not tolerate the well cooked warm food offered at the home. This HIV positive child suffered frequent bouts of diarrhoea. Staff at the home sometimes found her searching garbage bins for food and feeding on leftovers. \"It took us two whole months to bring her around and now she is doing very well in a normal school,\" he said. Apart from the children of the home, the foundation also works with 77 HIV positive children living in the community and about 650 non-infected children of HIV positive parents. This foundation has been able to successfully integrate HIV positive girls and boys into mainstream society, by their regular counseling and life skills classes. But according to Jose, girls more than boys face a lot of trauma on attaining puberty because society tries to stigmatize them as immoral persons. \"This is when they start hating their parents who are no longer alive. These girls become suicidal and depressed and need a lot of handholding to start realizing their potential as good individuals in society,\" he said. Boys on the other hand start thinking of life ahead and a future. Kumar, a boy who was expelled from a home for his mischief, is today a sturdy 18-year-old pursuing his SSLC at this home. He is also a caring brother to the smaller children; he wants to take up a career as a mechanical engineer. Selvam on the other hand who was brought to the home by his grandmother and aunt because his other relatives did not want him among them has no wish to study. But he is good with gadgets and wants to look after his grandmother and aunt well. On World AIDS Day, these children had a feast with 800 others to celebrate the occasion and look forward to life ahead. Jose says it is encouraging that the incidence of HIV/AIDS has come down in the state but added that the government should formulate a policy for the care and support for persons living with HIV/AIDS. \"In no way should AIDS control programmes be relaxed because there are many who still have not been brought back into mainstream society,\" he adds."}

The HSS showed that the HIV prevalence among FSW in 2010-11 has reduced from 3.82% to 1.28%. The national average of HIV prevalence among sex workers is 2.67%. In Rajasthan, the HIV prevalence among sex workers is below the national average. As part of the HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programme, the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) and the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) have been promoting sale of condoms among high-risk groups which include sex workers in the state under the Condom Social Marketing (CSM) programme. They have also opened more than 9,228 non-traditional outlets, to sell condoms in the state to minimize the risk of HIV infection and also to reduce total fertility rate. The NGOs working for health of sex workers claimed that the FSW have become more attentive to their health. Yuwa Bharat Sansthan programme manager Pinki Shekhawat said, \"We have been working for FSW for a long time. Among the 600 FSWs in Jaipur with whom we are working, only one was tested positive for HIV.\" She said the FSWs are using precautions properly to prevent HIV infection. \"Some of FSWs go to other states, which have high HIV prevalence, which is quite risky for them, but they are more careful there about their health,\" Shekhawat said. The FSWs undergo routine health check-up. The RSACS has also introduced targeted intervention to keep a check on the spread of prevalence of HIV among FSWs. There are around 22 targeted interventions working with FSW population in the state, RSACS sources said. In a survey conducted in 2005-06, it was found that there were 21,301 female sex workers in the state but now the number of FSW must have increased, an RSACS source added."}

The alarming figures were reported in the HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) 2010-11 report, released by Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad on Friday. The HIV prevalence in the age group of 15-49 years in the state has increased from 0.19% in 2008-09 to 0.49% in 2010-11, the report stated. While the national figures registered a dip of 0.27% for the same time frame, in Rajasthan the number of cases shot up by 0.30%. At the antenatal clinics, the HIV prevalence in Rajasthan is higher than neighbouring state Gujarat, which traditionally has a high number of pregnant women testing positive for HIV every year. According to the report, one out of 200 pregnant women tested positive for HIV in 2010-11 against one in 500 in 2008-09. The figures present a scary picture as the HIV prevalence among pregnant women has increased by more than two times. A large number of people also migrate to other big cities that have a high HIV prevalence which puts the state in the highly vulnerable category. People go to work in states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh which have high HIV prevalence, a health department official said. \"A large number of truckers pass through the state who are potential carriers of the HIV virus,\" another official said citing it as one of the reasons for high number of HIV positive cases in the state. Meanwhile, the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) have stepped up efforts to prevent the spread of HIV virus and has decided to extent testing facilities to the block level. A health department official, however, said the HSS figures are provisional. RSACS officials claimed that the HIV prevalence has not increased as per the figures collected from 182 existing Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTC). At the ICTC, the RSACS officials conduct counseling and conduct HIV voluntary testing."}

The centre's director Shashi Sahay, who closely worked with the HIV+ people, found patients living in the interior areas are irregular in collecting medicines from the free medicine distribution centres. \"Patients, especially women face apathy even from their family. In many cases, we find that they were kept in solitary confinement. The government is not keeping any record of such patients who were irregular in collecting medicines,\" she said. In many cases, they found that medicines to keep them fit become ineffective owing to malnourishment. Sahay cautioned the government that since state is turning into educational hub, Kota being one such example, youngsters are likely to indulge in activities which could contract HIV. \"Youth from all over the country in thousands are living here away from their families and therefore the probability to succumb to wrongful activities is higher,\" Sahay said. City-based NGOs working for HIV/AIDS left no stone unturned to organise several programmes creating awareness. RAYS organised a bike rally called BIKE-THON participated by motorcyclists and HIV+ children. The rally was kicked-off by Bollywood director Kabir Khan. Eighteen-month-old, Khushi, was the youngest HIV+ orphan at the event. \"Since Khushi came to our centre, all other kids have got little toys to play with. We have appointed one caretaker especially for Khushi,\" said Gurinder Virk, vice-president of RAYS adding that they adopted Khushi two months back.

Holding placards against stigma towards a HIV positive person, they urged people to spread a word against the ills of health that HIV and AIDS could lead to. Minister of health and family welfare Ahmed Hasan, who flagged off the rally, said that over one lakh positive persons are living in the state. He stated that the target is to minimise the number of new cases as far as possible. \"People usually tend to dismiss warnings given by experts who say that prevention is the best control of the disease. But this shows that they have not been able to assess the real depth of the problem. Awareness campaigns are a must for them,\" he stated. Preetam Kaur, a mother whose lost her daughter is suffering from to the stigma against HIV. AIDS has recently formed an HIV positive women welfare society. On behalf of the society, she distributed blankets and eatables to HIV positive persons undergoing treatment for complication of the disease at anti-retroviral therapy centre in Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. Along with volunteers, she warned patients and attendants visiting the hospital to be careful about HIV and AIDS. Contributions for the cause were made by the social organisations as well. In one such effort, a red ribbon truck was taken out by caring souls foundation. Lucknow's first citizen, Mayor Dinesh Sharma started a signature campaign on the truck, which moved to 20-25 different locations. In another programme, experts at Unicef spoke about the need to help positive mothers and children fight the complications. \"They all need the support of family members, neighbours, teachers, doctors and leaders to keep the complications of the primary infection at bay and lead a healthier life,\" said Adele Khudr, chief of field office, of Unicef UP. It may be noted that about 1,09,352 persons, including 42,647 are women and 4,811 are children below 15 years are living in UP. She added that while various agencies have been striving to do away discrimination from institutions like schools and hospitals, the more difficult struggle is to wipe out discrimination from the heart and mind of people. \"A change in mindset is the call of the hour. People living with HIV and AIDS need health care, counselling and above all our love, compassion. They need to feel that they have been accepted by all of us,\" she stated."}

Balangir has 70% of the state's MSM (men having sex with men) population. Official records reveal that in 2012, six HIV positive cases have been detected among the MSM community, which is considered a high-risk group. \"At present, there are 77 HIV positive patients in the district, who belong to the MSM community. This is 40% of the total number of HIV cases,\" said Ganeswar Panda, project manager at District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU). He said Balangir, which falls in the 'A' category in terms of spread of the disease, has come under serious threat owing largely to the MSMs. \"Most of the MSM cases go unreported and making them aware of the need for having safe sex is also very difficult. That is why the chance of spreading the disease through them is considerably high,\" said Panda. He added that Titilagarh being a railway junction and a transit point for going to Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh, MSMs carry the disease across state borders. \"Besides, there are some MSMs who operate at another level. Some persons belonging to the high society have also been tested positive after having sex with them,\" said Vikrant Kindo, the chief district medical officer. Apart from the MSMs, migrant labourers also carry the disease back home from their work place. The CDMO said that since 2002, migrant labourers have contributed to 30 percent of the positive cases in the district. \"This year, four migrant labourers have died after being tested positive for AIDS,\" the CDMO added."}

In all, 146 HIV+ cases were detected across Kishanganj district in 2007 which dropped to 145 in 2008. However, the HIV+ cases shot up to 252 in 2009 and was marginally down to 249 in 2010. It, thereafter, dropped to 161 in 2011,only to rise exponentially to 413 till October, 2012, according to official sources. The border district of Kishanganj, hedged in by Nepal on one side and Bangladesh on the other side, has been most vulnerable to the HIV+ menace. The huge migration of labourers to distant places and perennial problem of human trafficking only adds to the phenomenon, according to sources. In view of the district\u2019s susceptibility and vulnerability to the menace of HIV, Kishanganj was one of the seven districts in the country and the only district in Bihar where the World Health Organisation (WHO)) had launched the CHARCA programme to contain AIDS in 2004. However, the CHARCA programme was wound up in 2005, sources said. The Bihar State AIDS Control Society (BSACS) is actively campaigning to control the menace of AIDS. Altogether 32,598 persons, both male and female, were made to go through the grill of testing at various camps throughout the district. The year-wise break-up of such tests are 5,479 (2007), 6,628 (2008), 6,917 (2009), 7,496 (2010) and 6,079 (2011), according to official sources.The in-charge of the AIDs control programme, Dr N K Prasad, said that lack of awareness among the inhabitants in the district where illiteracy was still quite high was the prime factor behind such phenomenal incidence of HIV+ cases. \u201cPeople are still daunted by the stigma attached to HIV+ and would not volunteer any information about it till it goes beyond the limit of tolerance,\u201d say the doctors.

Ten-year-old Bharathi from the same home has composed background score for a documentary film on new drugs for TB. There are several other students in the institute who nurse similar ambitions. Many of them from the home have provided chorus for film scores. Be it traditional carnatic ragas or western harmonies and symphonies, these children can handle it all.

It\u2019s wonderful to see the kind of compositions that they come up with. Generally, many people trained in music may be good at vocals or instruments, but cannot really compose as they have not been taught to think that way. These kids are getting an early advantage. They can read music too.\u201d Another 14-year-old, Anusha too has music directorial ambitions and has already done some chorus work. \u201cI recently did chorus work for the film Mayil Parai,\u201d she said. \u201cI am hoping to become a music director when I grow up.\u201d While many HIV positve children in other parts of the country live in poverty and remain neglected with no hope of a decent life, let alone professional success, children at the Anandha Illam are lively and hopeful of a good future.

Ranjit Dubey, general secretary, JNP+, said in many states, including Odhisa, HIV+ patients get government travel allowance as most of the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) clinics, which provide free drugs, are far from villages. JNP+ wants the state government to follow suit. \"Patients, most of whom are migrant labourers, come from remote areas. Thus they have to spend a lot on transport to visit ART centres. So we want the Jharkhand government to start giving travel allowance to these patients,\" he said. Dubey said the government should also support women in remote pockets of the state, who were segregated for the infection. \"We will seek provision for these homeless women and their children in the Indira Awaas Yojana,\" he said, adding that the team would also demand for inclusion of poor women in the list of BPL card beneficiaries. There are instances where children of HIV+ patients do not get infected. But after the death of their parents, they have to work as child labourers. \"The society outcastes them even if they are not infected by the virus.

The additional director, JSACS, Birendra Prasad, questioned the data. \"It has not made it clear whether the data is about general use of condom or the sale of condoms at medical stores. And it's also difficult to assess the level of condom use,\" said Prasad. However, he stressed on the need for bringing behavioural change in which the coordination of other departments including the Panchayati Raj members, education and media would play a major role in creating awareness. \"As far as my opinion on the use of condom is concerned, I would say that there is definitely some increase in it and awareness level has also gone up. In earlier times, people hesitated to ask for condoms at medical shops but these days the scenario has changed. Condoms are sold and purchased openly. But more needs to be done to increase the level of awareness and its use,\" he said while emphasizing on the use of condom as the only measure to prevent the deadly disease AIDS. Prasad said they do not have a separate programme for condom promotion but within the umbrella programme of prevention of HIV transmission they try to counsel people on the use of condom and its benefits. The counselling session takes place on special occasions like the AIDS Day. The additional director, although, was not able to recall the exact numbers of condoms distributed and in demand last year, but said approximately 40 lakh was needed by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and that they have been distributed in all the ART centres and government hospitals. \"Even if we go by this record then also no one can say that there has been a decline in the use of condoms in the state,\" he added."}

However, his world changed after the visit, as the blood test revealed that he was HIV positive. Prakhar was shattered. However, a year later, still unhappy with his fate, he's coping well and feels that the early detection, though unintended, saved his life. What happened to Prakhar brings to fore the grim reality of high prevalence of HIV positive people in the state who are ignorant of their status. Data provided by Chhattisgarh State AIDS Control Society (CSACS) reveals that of the total people who donated blood in 2011 in the state as many as 157 were found to be HIV positive. These people were not aware of the fact that they were carriers of the deadly virus. The detections happened as the donated blood is mandatorily tested for HIV virus and is completely destroyed, if found infected. Statistics show that there are 16 government and 22 private blood banks in the state, which collect blood through camps and also through replacements. Last year, 8185 units of blood was collected in camps and 50,132 people donated voluntarily. Of the 50,132 voluntary donations, 157 donors were found positive for HIV, implying that one out of every 320 people were carriers of the AIDS virus. According to the Chhattisgarh State Aids Control Society, transfusion of HIV-infected blood is also a major reason for transmission of the virus. The society stated that one should take blood only from a licensed blood bank where it is tested for HIV. In 2008, around 10,534 people had donated blood out of which 145 were tested HIV positive. In 2009 this figure increased to 150, from 24,164 donors. In 2010, of the 49,458 blood donations 154 were found to be positive for HIV. To deal with the problem, the CSACS has taken the issue seriously and kick-started awareness campaigns on HIV/AIDS, interacting with people in their local dialects on the requisite precautions to be taken for the disease."}

The clinic in its report said he had tested positive for HIV I and II and declared him unfit for the job, Dilshad said adding that when he got his blood tested at four other labs, including AIIMS, the results came back negative for HIV. The lab in its defence has said it was going to hold the tests again after four to six weeks to confirm the results and had followed the proper procedures for conducting such tests. The forum, however, rejected the contention saying the defence taken does not mitigate the lab's liability."}

Most of them are orphans even before the age of five. Keeping them alive despite availability of good medicines is quite a task that usually falls on the grandparents. Even with their own health dwindling and no financial support, they are still determined to do their best until they are alive. Big question, however, is what after them? Mamta Godghate, 70, and grandmother of 13-year-old Satyajeet (all names changed), whose parents died when he was just three, narrates the spine chilling story of she working day in and out as a daily wager breaking stones for road making to earn daily bread for her grandson and her sick husband. Tears roll down her cheeks but her words are full of determination. \"I know I am old but I will strive for my grandson till my last breath. It is my duty. I will make him strong enough to take life in his stride before I die,\" she says. There were many grandparents sharing similar stories at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on Tuesday during a programme organized by the medicine department's ART (antiretroviral therapy) centre to felicitate children living with HIV/AIDS and encourage them to continue taking medicines and bring a feeling of belongingness in them. Sushma Kathare, grandmother of Kumar who works as farm labourer in Waddhamna, brings her grandson religiously to GMCH once a month. \"Medicines are free but sometimes I don't have money for even the bus ride. I have to borrow but I don't let him miss medicine,\" she said. Aunt of 10-year-old Natisha was thrown out of her own house by her sons for bringing up a HIV positive child but is determined to give him good education. Though their caretakers may be worried, the children are mostly unaware of the gravity of their own disease. They are aware they are HIV-positive and need medication regularly to survive. \"I did not take medicines regularly. My parents died, so I lived for sometime with my uncles. They didn't take me to hospital and said I deserved to die. I am now living in an orphanage. Now I am on second line of ART only because I discontinued the medicines,\" said 13-year-old Kshitij who came alone for the programme. There were two other boys who also had come alone but were being brought up by their grandparents. GMCH dean Dr Rajaram Powar, medicine head Dr Y B Bansod, ART Centre senior medical officer Dr Megha Navade, centre counsellor Preeti Kadu, and the chief guest Raje Sangram Singh Bhosale, city businessman Kishor Rathi and Tanuja Sheware felicitated the children and gave them blankets, books, balls and toys."}

HIV and AIDS strikes people from all backgrounds, gender and age. The only way to stay away from AIDS is to prevent it by adopting proper precautions, as there is no cure available. To help prevent the spread of HIV, Dr. Rina from Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai, shares easy measures that can be easily incorporated in your life to prevent HIV and AIDS. Avoid multi sexual partners If you favour one night stands or you have multi sex partners, the chances of contracting HIV is high. Staying away from sexual activity involving contact with anyone\u2019s vaginal fluid or pre-seminal fluid is the best and most effective technique to avoid getting AIDS \u2013 says Dr. Rina. Educate yourself Some people feel HIV spreads through sharing food with HIV+ people. Get your facts about AIDS right \u2013 says Dr, Rina. HIV only spreads through transmission of certain bodily fluids carried by an infected person. Go deep and find out which bodily fluids could result in acquiring HIV. Lastly, understand its diagnosis. Though there is no cure available in the market, there are numerous modern medicines which help to slow down the development of AIDS and help the person live a comfortable life. Prevent HIV during pregnancy There are huge chances of transmitting the HIV virus from an HIV affected mother to the infant during delivery or breastfeeding. Hence, in order to keep your baby safe, get an HIV test done when you are pregnant. If tested positive, your doctor will prescribe anti-HIV drugs during pregnancy and delivery, which can reduce the risk of passing the virus to your baby. After delivery, choose formula milk or breast milk from an uninfected woman, advises Dr. Rina. Use a condom every time you have sex Dr Rina suggests that you use a new condom every time you have anal or vaginal sex. Women can prefer female condoms to be on the safer side. If you are opting for oral sex, use a condom, dental dam or plastic wrap to prevent the infection from being transmitted. Check yourself regularly Get yourself tested regularly to check your AIDS status. This will help you prevent passing the infection to others and timely treatment can help you lead a healthy lifestyle. Hence, get yourself tested, whenever you have sex with a new partner. The test is easy and the reports will be available in a few days or as soon as 20 minutes. Avoid oily lubricants Dr Rina says \u2013 using an oil based lubricant will weaken the condom and increase the chances of transmitting the fluid. Hence use water based lubricants instead of oil based lubricants to stay safe. Avoid sharing needles Do not share needles with anyone, which includes illegal drug use or any prescribed drug use at home. Sharing needles will lead to coming in contact with someone else\u2019s blood, putting you at risk of the HIV infection. Health care practitioners should be cautious A healthcare facility is at a huge risk of receiving AIDS. Hence, be careful while dealing with needles and sharp instruments. Make sure to wear gloves, mask and other protective gear to avoid contact with the blood of anyone who is infected with HIV. Your personal items are only for you Avoid sharing any of your personal items like razors or toothbrushes with anyone. Your personal items can have traces of blood and sharing these items with any new person can lead to transmission of blood and putting you at risk of catching the infection.

Neither has been any survey conducted to ascertain the level of awareness about HIV/AIDS, its prevention and safe sex among youngsters. The National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) in its latest guidelines stresses on surveys after every two years. With the focus of the AIDS control programme on increasing awareness among the youths, the health authorities have failed to figure if there has been any improvement in the awareness level among city youths. Dr Uggar Singh Sooch, district programme officer of HIV/AIDS, said they had last conducted a HIV sentinel surveillance survey in 2008 in Ludhiana, but no survey was conducted after that. All that the health authorities have done during this period is to maintain a regular record of new cases. Sooch said the new NACP guidelines are a part of NACP-IV, which is yet to start. \"I acknowledge that a comprehensive survey would have helped in planning the move ahead based on the statistics, but there have been certain factors that hinder the process. Unlike cancer, where people come forward for survey, there is a stigma attached to HIV/AIDS that keeps many from participating in a survey,\" he added. Sooch said they haven't devised any survey that lets them ascertain if the awareness among people about AIDS has improved, but as a casual observation, he adds, \"It may have increased over the years\". Dr Jasbir Dhanoa, former head, department of medicine at Christian Medical College and Hospital who has worked on HIV/AIDS in the city, said, \"Fighting HIV/AIDS is one of the most important concerns of the country. A survey should be done every two years, but it is up to the government to implement the suggestions.\" Social activist Ajaydeep Singh who has been involved with various causes, said a survey to figure out the trends and awareness level regarding the disease should be conducted immediately if it hasn't been conducted over last five years. Proper statistics would help the authorities devise a proper plan to tackle the spread of the disease,\" added Singh."}

He attends regular school and aspires to be an engineer one day. Yet, he can't be counted among those millions of children who on completing their education, will go into the profession of their choice, become parents and grow old. Varun's case is different because he is HIV positive. At his age and oblivious of his life threatening condition Varun wants to excel in his studies brushing aside the occasional bout of illness. \"I'm studying in class IV,\" he told TOI. His mother Radha corrected him saying, \"He is in class I studying in the English medium.\" Radha came to Goa from Karwar with her two sons to avail of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Varun who had studied up to class IV in the Kannada medium was admitted to class I in a boarding school in Goa where the medium of instruction is English. \"He didn't know English when he came last year but he is catching up fast,\" his proud mother said. Varun might not understand what afflicts him, but thanks to his monthly trips to the ART centre he has sensed that \"something is very wrong with him\". His eyes turn moist and he tries to hide behind his mother when asked \"whether he is sick or if he feels sick\". The ART center at Goa medical college and hospital (GMC) provides ART to about 2,000 HIV persons, including 250-300 children. Dr Vanda Viegas of the ART centre said HIV infected children are also put on ART to protect them from opportunistic infections. \"With good care and intake of nutritional food they can lead a normal life,\" Viegas said. Viegas said that in the absence of any concrete study it is difficult to tell how long a person on ART will live. \"There are no studies done here,\" Viegas said. During the last seven years since the ART centre was started in GMC, at least four children that were on ART have died. Radha tested positive for HIV during her first pregnancy. She knows she got the infection from her husband who died two years ago but accepted it with equanimity. She stays in Margao in a tiny rented premises paying a monthly rent of Rs 600, and takes up odd jobs to support herself and her two sons.

They seek the latter despite being denied of the former. On Sunday, members of city chapter of Blind Graduates Forum of India (BGFI) got an insight into how to go about this vision. The occasion was a workshop on 'reading without seeing' that introduced the attendees to a few technologies that help them access books, news, electronic communication and much more. It was inaugurated by paediatrician Dr Sunil Bajaj. Trainers from a Mumbai-based Xavier's Resource Centre for Visually Challenged had specially come to demonstrate some of their technologies that could help the visually challenged. On the occasion, Amravati based international swimmer Kanchanmala Pande, who too is totally blind, was the chief guest. She and the other members of the forum spoke about the low social expectations and acceptability of disabled people. Among the technologies showcased were some special applications on computers such as screen readers that speak out the text and magnification software which increase the font. They are useful for people with low vision and OCR readers that can scan the text and read it out. \"Today, we have a range of appliances from thermometers to microwave ovens that have the 'talking' feature. Government calls their efforts to include such technologies in public utilities as 'reasonable accommodation'. Rather than being accommodated, we prefer to say that we are enabling ourselves,\" said Rajesh Assudani, national vice president of BGFI. Kanchanmala, who has won many international awards, uses a tapping device that helps her avoid bumping into people and things while under water. \"It was difficult 10 years ago when I started swimming but now things have become easier. The credit goes to my parents as they always encouraged me,\" she said adding that children suffering from any disability must be supported by their parents so that they become confident and independent. A teacher at an agricultural college at Warora, Ghanshyamdas Assudani, said the apparent attitudinal changes in the society are only at the material level but not mental. \"But it's all right,\" he said, adding, \"Big social changes take time to happen.\" Collegian Rahul Bajaj, who was a topper in both SSC and HSC examinations, however, sees this difference everyday among his friends and classmates. \"Whether it is attending classes or bunking them and hanging out, my friends ensure that I am part of the group. I don't find most people I meet rude or gruff, but I don't like it when they are sympathetic or overprotective,\" he said. Rahul feels this outlook stems from the society's low expectation from people with disabilities. \"Why else would people say they did this despite the disability whenever we accomplish something? Sometimes, I am asked why I want to hang out with my friends when it would be safer at home,\" he said. Assudani sums up the feeling, \"People think that disability means that we are not supposed to find pleasure in activities that 'normal' people do. We are expected to stick to the essentials and leave out the other things.\" Some popular software for visually challenged JAWS (job Access with speech): A computer screen reader that runs on Windows NVDA (Non Visual Desktop Access): An open source software for Windows Mobile speak: A software that converts a cell phone to a talking phone to help a person make and receive calls, read and write messages and access many other functionalities of the phone Talks: Software for mobiles, including those with touch screens"}

But as he awaits discharge from Jaslok Hospital, his positive feelings are tinged with bitterness. Although his mother, Kamala (name changed) donated one of her kidneys to her first-born son in operations held on February 1, the family had to wait for seven months to complete the paperwork needed for the transplant. \"I live in Mumbai while my mother lives in Azamgarh district in Uttar Pradesh. We went back and forth several times in this period to get the paperwork done,'' he said. The delay was caused mainly due to the stringent transplant rules. \"Here, a mother has given a kidney to her son. As per the transplant Act, this is a familial transplant and doesn't require any no-objection certificate,'' said Dr Rushi Deshpande, who is Singh's nephrologist. But Maharashtra government rules require an NOC even in case of families when the donor is from outside the state. In fact, the matter is being heard by the Bombay high court following a petition filed by a nephrologist protesting against this rule. \"The hospital had told us five months back that my husband is healthy enough to undergo a transplant, but the paperwork delayed us immensely,'' said Singh's wife. She was particularly worried about his counts falling due to his HIV status. \"Even though his HIV specialist Dr J K Maniar managed to keep his counts well, it was difficult for us to find a hospital that was willing to conduct his dialysis. We were charged extra for each session because of his condition,'' she added. On February 1, after 17 days of preparation and a seven-month wait, the operation was carried out. \"The most difficult aspect of a transplant for an HIV-positive patient is the tightrope walk between avoiding rejection and complex infections (due to HIV). So it took us 17 days to work out the right combination for Singh,'' said Dr Deshpande, adding that Singh would be discharged on Wednesday with a normal kidney function showing serum creatnine of 1. Singh is the third HIV-positive patient to get a kidney in Mumbai. When contacted, a senior government official said the government was, on directions from the high court, reworking the NoC clause."}

A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Indermeet Kaur then asked the counsel to file a fresh status report by March 13, 2013, saying \"an endeavor be made to find out as to the reason why the victim is making allegations against other children and as to who is actually responsible for abuse of the victim.\" HC took notice of the case on the basis of a TOI report highlighting the allegations leveled by the child against three others. The bench had directed the authorities to conduct a medical examination of the victim and the other boys he had accused of sexual abuse. It had also asked the police to verify and investigate.

Ammonium nitrate (AN) was also used in the explosives at the Hyderabad blasts. Earlier use of the material in terror blasts had led to a hue and cry to regulate its use. But despite draft rules prepared in 2009, AN continues to be freely available in India. Sources in the business say a tussle between the departments of home and commerce is the root cause of the delay in regulating the explosive. Although the final rules on the issue have been issued in July 2012, they will be applicable only four months from now, since the government had allowed a year's time for them to be effective. Until that time, all a terrorist needs to do is mix AN, which can be easily purchased from any dealer's shop, with diesel, which is also freely available. The mixture packed in a container can be blown up with a detonator. A bomb made with this crude formula can be deadlier than the regular commercial AN used in large-scale mining activities, say sources in this segment. The mixture, known as ANFO in technical jargon, is commonly used in quarries and construction activities, where commercial explosives are not required. All users make their own ANFO. There are theories that AN pilfered from such sources lands in the hands of terrorists. AN is used as an ingredient in slurry and emulsion-based commercial explosives. But such explosives are less potent than a crude bomb made with diesel, due to the sizeable water content in it, sources said. The first time draft rules on ammonium nitrate were released in 2009, they came under the ambit of the Arms Act, which is governed by the police. The home department, however, insisted that the police do not have expertise in the matter and hence city-based Petroleum and Explosives Organization (PESO) - which comes under ministry of commerce and industry, was given the job. PESO drafted its own rules under the Explosives Act, which were released for public comments in mid-2011. The industry was not too comfortable with this development too. Finally, after the entire process was completed afresh, the rules were finally notified in July 2012, but with a provision that they would become applicable a year later. The rules provide for strict monitoring of sale purchase, storage and transportation of AN. The current rules provide for securing a PESO permission for making ANFO, which would be granted on the basis of a clearance by the district magistrate. In case it is in mining areas, the initial clearance will come from Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS). However, some manufacturers of commercial explosives have raised a concern that even these rules give enough leeway for slippage. ANFO users can easily get a PESO licence on the basis of a simple clearance. Leftover explosive being sold off in the grey market was a common practice in this business, although such surplus did not reach antinational elements intentionally. However, officials claim the loophole has been plugged for bigger commercial explosive makers due to a strict monitoring system being put in place. PESO also has a strict formulation to assess the explosive used against the blasting done. A manufacturing licence can be given only after a strict scrutiny by Intelligence Bureau. But the norms are too easy for smaller players, who just use ANFO, said a source."}

This for your kind information\" The member did not even request for grant of any leave and appeared to be more of an intimation of absence, BDO, V S Naik Gaunekar noted. The doctor's certificate also appeared to refer to the member's illness in the past tense. \"This is to certify that Cruz Joao Vales from Agasaim was sick and was suffering from viral fever from October 25, 2012. He was under my treatment and was advised rest for 6 (six) days.\" The BDO noted in his order that the certificate was written six days after October 25, 2012 while the meeting was held on October 29, 2012. The certificate was attached to the leave application filed before the meeting! May be, the doctor put the date as October 25, 2012 at the request of the member, he observed. The BDO held that the leave application was clearly afterthought and the inward book was manipulated in connivance with the panchayat clerk."}

This is the first child \u2014 and only the second HIV-infected person \u2014 to have been cured of the disease, if the claim announced on Sunday by a research team from Johns Hopkins Children\u2019s Center (JHCC) and the University of Massachusetts Medical School is found to be true. The team hoped that the success could be replicated in other children born with HIV which would pave the way for eliminating the disease among children. HIV-related breakthroughs are rare and finding a vaccine has been a daunting challenge thanks to the ability of the virus to slip through. The researchers put a Mississippi-born infant, whose mother is HIV-positive, to antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 30 hours of birth. The prompt administration led to the cure by halting the formation of hard-to-treat viral reservoirs \u2014 dormant cells responsible for reigniting the infection in most HIV patients within weeks of stopping the therapy. A series of tests showed progressively diminishing viral presence in the infant's blood, until it reached undetectable levels 29 days after birth. The infant remained on antivirals till 18 months of age. Ten months after the treatment was discontinued, the child underwent repeated blood tests, none of which detected HIV. Test for HIV-specific antibodies \u2014 the infection\u2019s standard clinical indicator \u2014 also remained negative throughout. \u201cPrompt ART in newborns that begins within days of exposure may help infants clear the virus and achieve long-term remission without lifelong treatment by preventing such viral hideouts from forming in the first place,\u201d said JHCC virologist Deborah Persaud. \u201cOur next step is to find out if this is a highly unusual response to very early antiretroviral therapy or something we can actually replicate in other high-risk newborns,\u201d Persaud added. Will it work for adults? The only other HIV-positive person to be cured was Timothy Brown, a middle-aged man with leukemia who got cured after receiving a bone-marrow transplant from a donor genetically resistant to HIV infection. In the current case, the New York Times cited experts saying they needed convincing that the baby had truly been infected in the first place. \u201cIf not, this would be a case of prevention, something already done for babies born to infected mothers,\u201d it reported. Other experts were quoted as saying that the findings in the baby would probably not be relevant to adults. The researchers said they did not have enough data at the moment to recommend changes to the current practice of using preventive rather than therapeutic treatment for high-risk infants. They said complete viral eradication on a large scale was their long-term goal. \u201cBut, for now, (it) remains out of reach, and our best chance may come from aggressive, timely and precisely targeted use of antiviral therapies in high-risk newborns as a way to achieve functional cure,\u201d the researchers said in their report. Functional cure allows a patient to be free of the HIV virus without lifelong treatment, besides preventing HIV replication in the blood. In this case, viral presence is so minimal that it remains undetectable by standard clinical tests. It is discernible only through ultrasensitive methods. \u201cPrevention really is the best cure, and we already have proven strategies that can prevent 98% of newborn infections by identifying and treating HIV-positive pregnant women,\u201d the report said. The UN estimates that 330,000 babies were infected in 2011. This is apart from more than three million children living with HIV around the world. In India, more than 14,000 children got infected in 2011, which accounted for 13% decline compared to 2009. The number of estimated deaths among children (0-14 years old) due to AIDS was 10,213 in 2011. A latest UNAIDS Global HIV Epidemic Report revealed that 72% HIV-infected children in India and South East Asia do not have access to treatment. In India, children accounted for 7% of an estimated 21 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS in 2011. Around 40% (8.16 lakh) of them were women, who are likely to pass on the virus to their children."}

In March 2012, when funding agencies such as UNAIDS and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation wound up operations and handed over projects to Tansacs, the society ordered an evaluation of all projects. In Salem and Namakkal districts, at least 23 dead people had not been taken off the HIV/AIDS risk group registers. \u201cSome women were alive but too old for sex work. Yet, they weren\u2019t removed from the register. When we asked the NGOs to strike off such names, they opposed it,\u201d said a senior official in charge of the evaluation process.

Tansacs allots Rs 14 lakh to Rs 15 lakh for 1,500 people on the register.

But determined to fight and overcome all odds, these young Muslim activists of Kalyan Red Ribbon Club (RRC) have today ushered in a silent revolution in this village. This includes an outreach strategy to address HIV+ prevention, care and support and treatment in this vulnerable district. Talking about sex was virtually taboo in this village, so for young Muslim girls, mostly in their teens, initiating any discussion on the issue was to invite controversy. But that is what Amina Khatoon, a 17-year-old girl, has done ever since she was made president of the 70-member RRC. She comes from a poor family and also works as a part-time dressmaker. April 14, 2009, was a memorable day for Amina when Nirdesh (an NGO) link worker Kumkum Kumari, formed the Kalyan Red Ribbon Club (KRRC) at the village with 21 girls. Prior to this, these girls had never come out in the open without \u2018purdah\u2019 and mingled with each other freely. The most sensitive and important issue about which they learnt was the disastrous effect of HIV/AIDS. \u201cI had to make a huge effort to make these girls understand the challenge of HIV/AIDS, particularly in rural areas, as here it becomes more pronounced in view of stigma and discrimination surrounding HIV, resulting in poor access to health care, and, above all, infections going undetected or treated by unqualified practitioners,\u201d said Kumkum. Soon these girls started spreading awareness about prevention and protection from HIV/AIDS among the rural community. They were also imparted training at various places, which changed their outlook and provided them a broader vision. The effort made by these girls was soon recognized by Unicef too. The girls were then provided a sewing machine and a ceiling fan. Today these girls, apart from generating social awareness are also learning skills like stitching, puppet-making, hosiery making etc to make their life better. KRRC is constantly expanding its base and now has 70 members, of which 20 are young boys. Sajda, Naznin, Momina, Shaba, Ruksana, Raksa, Mohd Raja, Aftab\u2026 all are enthusiastically involved in their assignments.

The centre would be formally launched by Dr Manohar Pawar , deputy director of health services, on Friday at 11am . Speaking to reporters about the centre, district civil surgeon Dr V D Bade said that the satellite town of Kamptee attracted a lot of a migrant population due to various companies, collieries, and transport businesses and this brought in commercial sex workers as well. Hence, the health department provided for the ART centre for better treatment of HIV-positive patients of the area. With this centre, they would not need to come to city to procure drugs that are to be taken by the affected persons all their life. Though there has been a substantial fall in the HIV-positive mothers as well as the high risk population in Nagpur district in the past 4-5 years, there has been a rise in cases in Kamptee area both in general population as well as of mothers. Tanuja Fale, district programme officer HIV/AIDS project, said the incidence of HIV positivity inn mothers had fallen from 0.32% (171 positive) to 0.17% (88 positive) from 2011 to February 2013. This figure in high risk population has, however, seen only a marginal fall from 3.20% (2300 positive persons) to 3.07% (1768 persons) during the same period. The HIV positivity rate in the town was as high as 7% in general population and 0.63% in mothers in 2008 but the rate dropped substantially over the years. Yet there is still a cause of concern for the relatively high number of patients in both the groups and hence the need for a separate ART Centre in Kamptee which draws people for work from even areas like Pardi Naka, Tarsa and Mouda. This year alone, the health department has found 61 more new cases. The state health department, with financial help from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), is starting the centre to cater to the local population. NACO would be providing funds for the salaries of all the seven staff members including the medical officers, technical and lab staff, counsellors and project coordinators. Health department is working in coordination with other agencies like Indira Gandhi Government Medical College, Government Medical College and Hospital, Daga Memorial Hospital as well selected private hospitals in the city to filter out patients of the area and provide them drugs at Kamptee itself as the high risk population needed to be monitored regularly to check the spread of the disease.

The city has recorded a remarkable dip in the number of cross-infections and the success has been attributed to early detection and awareness. HIV, per se, does not kill but rather makes the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections by lowering immunity. Tuberculosis takes the top spot as the biggest opportunistic infection and killer among HIV patients. Statistics compiled by the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) has revealed how in the last six years the incidence of tuberculosis in HIV suspects has halved. If 15% of patients who walked in for HIV testing in 2007 were found to be suffering from TB, it came down to 7% till last year. The same trend has been witnessed in those suffering from tuberculosis. TB patients remain highly vulnerable to HIV as global numbers suggest that around 13-14% end up contracting the bacterial infection. Here too, the MDACS records show that significant improvement has been made. From an incidence of 10% TB patients contracting HIV, the percentage has come down to 3% and remained there in the last two years. Additional project director of MDACS Dr Balkrishna Adsul said increased awareness among both set of patients could be one of the main reasons. According to Dr Minni Khetarpal, BMC\u2019s special tuberculosis officer, a smooth synchronization of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) and the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) has contributed to almost 100% of the patients suffering from the co-infection getting the right drugs. \u201cWe have made it mandatory for the TB officers to send the patients for HIV testing within a month of enrolling in RNTCP,\u201d she said."}

The machine has proven useful for patients from 20 districts of eastern UP including Ballia, Pratapgarh, Sonbhadra, Kaushambi, Gonda and Fatehpur. Allahabad is the eighth city in the country to have the Gene Xpert device after Pune, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and Thiruvanthapuram. Dr OP Shahi, district tuberculosis officer told TOI that apart from 101 tests, the department had admitted 36 patients at Dott Plus site at medical college for treatment. He added that patients have been advised to stay for a week at Dott Plus site and are discharged after treatment. Dr Shahi said Gene Xpert is used for conducting a test -- Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (CBNAAT) -- approved and recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). He added that it can help in three times the detection of drug-resistant TB cases. With more fresh cases of TB-MDR (Multi-Drug Resistant) surfacing every month in and around Allahabad region, Gene Xpert is proving useful for doctors. \"We have gone through all the exercises for Gene Xpert and are monitoring how the machine helps in early detection of TB and drug resistant TB,\" added Dr Shahi. He said the device is helpful in detecting cases of extremely drug resistant TB (XXDR-TB) as well and has been installed under the RNTCP (revised national TB control programme). The device is easy to install and can be used by paramedical staff. The new test aims to increase diagnosis of the deadly disease by at least seven-fold. Doctors say the device is fully integrated and can easily detect mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as Refampicin resistance-conferring mutations directly from sputum."}

While the tests carried out by a Chennai-based lab have confirmed that the baby has the deadly virus, they have ruled out that the source of the disease is either her parents or a donor. Doctors in both the states now say that only a paternity test will reveal if the father of the baby is her biological parent. \"We got an oral report from the Chennai-based lab that the DNA PCR test revealed that the girl is HIV positive, while both parents are negative. We are yet to receive the report copy,\" said the doctor at the hospital. \"Maybe the parents are wrongly claiming that she is their child. A paternity test will perhaps reveal the truth,\" said a doctor at the Guntur Medical College, who cannot be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media. Her father and a donor had once donated blood to her. But district health authorities informed that the donor was traced and he tested negative for HIV. Now, the flummoxed medical team suspects the donor could have been in the window period (time between the onset of HIV infection and the appearance of detectable antibodies of the virus) when the blood was transfused to the child. Any antibody-based blood tests, such as ELISA and rapid test, conducted during the window period may give negative results. During this window period the individual is already infected and may unknowingly infect other people. Doctors say a thorough probe can also reveal if the child was adopted or a healthy baby was swapped after birth. \"There are endless possibilities, but the case has become so complicated,\" a hospital source said. Doctors at the Guntur hospital are now preparing the girl for Anti Retroviral Therapy to suppress the HIV virus and stop its progression. But taking her condition into consideration, it is unlikely that the therapy will start immediately, they said. The baby was given blood transfusion on March 8 after she was found to be suffering from anaemia. As her condition did not improve doctors conducted tests and found that she was HIV positive. The girl was tested HIV positive at a private hospital at Kothapet about four days after she was admitted with pneumonia. As they were not sure, they wanted to carry out fresh tests."}

The latter are still treated like pariahs and shown the door even at government hospitals. Last week, a 35-year-old HIV-positive vegetable vendor was turned out of RG Kar Hospital and asked to seek treatment elsewhere. A day earlier, he had been referred to the hospital by Calcutta Medical College, which said it did not have the facilities to treat him. Also suffering from HIV-induced oral cancer, Mohammed Tariq (name changed) is now under treatment at a private hospital where he received his first dose of chemotherapy on Sunday, which happened to be World Health Day. Having contracted the deadly virus two years ago, Tariq was under treatment at the School of Tropical Medicine (STM). He was on anti retro-virus therapy drugs supplied by the STM. In January, Tariq developed a cancerous ulcer near the tongue which got infected. Doctors believe it was triggered by the HIV. When he sought treatment for the ulcer at Calcutta Medical College, he was promptly referred to RG Kar Hospital. Last Monday, Tariq went to the emergency department of RG Kar. He says he was shunted around from the oncology department to the surgery section and finally to the hospital's HIV division. \"After two days, I was asked to resume treatment for HIV, even though I had visited the hospital for my mouth ulcer. They said it won't be of any use till my HIV was controlled. When I asked if I could continue treatment at the hospital, they refused and asked me to leave,\" said Tariq, a resident of Rajabazar. In immense pain and barely able to speak, Tariq was taken to a private hospital by neighbours on Wednesday. He received blood transfusion at the hospital and got his first dose of chemotherapy on Sunday. Doctors said his oral cancer needs greater attention now, for his HIV is under control. \"HIV might have triggered the oral cancer. Often, it causes lymphoma, oral cancer or cancer in the genitals. But contrary to what he was told at the government hospital, Tariq's ulcer needs to be treated now. It seems he was shooed away due to his HIV status,\" said Ashish Mukhopadhyay, who is treating him. Although his condition was serious, Tariq was still in a state to receive palliative therapy that could keep him reasonably healthy for a few more years, he added. Deserted by his wife, Tariq is now looked after by his two brothers. He has not been able to work for the last six months. \"With each passing month, he has been getting weaker. As if the HIV was not bad enough, he got oral cancer six months ago. The pain has been excruciating and he has barely been able to eat. But the treatment at the government hospitals was shocking. They just refused to treat him,\" said Mohammed Moin, his brother-in-law. RG Kar authorities, on the other hand, argued that HIV-positive patients are often asked to continue treatment for the virus when they seek redress for another ailment. \"As the rules say, HIV patients are treated on a par with others. We are not permitted to disclose their HIV status even to the hospital staff. But we must handle them carefully, for they are carrying a contagious virus. So, we often advise them to make sure that they continue their treatment for HIV and are referred to our HIV centre. Strangely, patients often take this as refusal. I am not aware of Tariq's case, but it seems unlikely that he was shooed away just because he had the disease. At any given point of time, RG Kar has at least 8 to 10 HIV patients who are being treated alongside the rest,\" said Ajoy Ray, medical superintendent of RG Kar. The West Bengal Aids Control and Prevention Society said it was illegal to either refuse treatment or turn away an HIV patient. \"In case we receive a complaint, we shall investigate the matter,\" said Himadri Sekhar Sanyal, the deputy project manager of the society. Mukhopadhyay pointed out that while Tariq needed to carry on his HIV treatment, his oral cancer (buccalmucosa carcinoma) was worsening and might have caused death. \"Without chemotherapy, he wouldn't have survived more than a few months more,\" he said."}

In the past three years, the HIV positive cases have come down in both pregnant women and the public. Among 75,424 tested pregnant women, 457 tested positive in the period April 2009 to March 2010 while in April 2010 to March 2011, among 73,118 women tested, 312 cases were found positive. In the period April 2011 to March 2012, 1,23,857 women underwent HIV test, and 262 were found positive while during April 2012 to February 2013, 82,613 were tested and 167 found positive.

Dr Balakrishna N Tukkar of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit, Belgaum district, said: \"Thanks to awareness, pregnant women come voluntarily for the test now, which was not the case six to seven years back. With the help of central and state governments and with the support from NGOs, we conducted various awareness programmes like street plays, counselling of sex workers and competitions in schools and colleges. Once the patients are tested HIV positive, we conduct pre- and post- counselling. There are five ART centres in Belgaum district, each in Belgaum, Savadatti, Chikkodi, Athani and Gokak taluk. Patiensts are given free tablets at these centres.'' He added: \"After the government launched the Parent to Children Transmission Programme in 2006, the number of children succumbing to HIV positive due to mother has come down drastically. Under this programme, anti-retroviral tablets are given to pregnant women who are tested HIV positive from their fourth month of pregnancy. Through this, even if a mother is HIV positive, the baby will not get it.'' The NGOs also play a pivotal role. They keep track of the patients. If they discontinue tablets, they counsel them and get them to ART Centre and give the tablets."}

Sources suspect the children may have fallen prey to sexual exploitation. A counselor who handled the case of a girl whose HIV status was established at the age of nine, said sessions with the girl and her parents were inconclusive as to the source of infection. Both parents tested negative for HIV. \"The mother told me she never left her daughter in the company of strangers. The girl has now turned 13 and is taking ART treatment,\" the counselor said. The counselor was also not able to get any information from the girl on any sexual exposure. In two other similar cases, parents were found to be negative. One of the boys was raped by a person who was HIV positive. \"It was a medico-legal case and it was established that boy had been raped,\" the counselor said. In the other case of any infected male child counselors reached a dead end as neither are parents infected nor did medical history reveal any blood transfusion. \"We suspect he must have been sexually exploited as we don't see any other way how he could have got the infection at this young age,\" the counselor said. A few months back another case was referred to the ART counselor wherein a 13 year-old-girl was raped by a HIV infected person. Though her first test was negative, her status will be known only after the window the period is over. Presently, over 200 HIV positive children who were infected a birth by their parents are receiving ART in GMC's ART centre. Senior medical officer Dr Vanda Viegas told TOI doctors have to encourage parents to ensure that the children are brought for treatment on time. \"The tendency is to wait till the child falls really ill. Children are more vulnerable to opportunistic infections,\" Viegas said.

Passing orders on the appeal filed by lorry driver P Ravikumar, the judge said that in 1955 when the Hindu Marriage Act came into existence, HIV was not heard of. However, as per Section 13(v) of the Act if a spouse is suffering from a venereal disease in a communicable form, it is a valid ground for divorce, he said. Justice Ramanathan, noting that he had perused materials available on the internet, concluded that HIV infection being a communicable health hazard, a person testing positive for the virus should be considered an acceptable ground for divorce. \u201cIn the year 1955, HIV was not heard of and, therefore, it was not named in the Hindu Marriage Act as one of the grounds for dissolution of marriage. But having regard for the fact that venereal disease in a communicable form has been mentioned as one of the grounds for divorce, any such disease will also come under the provision of the Section 13(v). Therefore, it cannot be contended that HIV-positive condition is not included under the section and therefore divorce cannot be granted,\u201d Justice Ramanathan said. The matter relates to the matrimonial dispute between the couple from Sankagiri in Salem district. On an application from Ravikumar, a sub-court dissolved their marriage on April 3, 2007. However, hearing the appeal filed by his wife, the additional district court in Salem on January 31, 2008 ruled that divorce cannot be granted. Ravikumar then approached the high court. When the matter was taken up for hearing, his wife\u2019s counsel denied that she was HIV-positive and argued that since her husband was a driver visiting various places during his duty, if at all she is afflicted with HIV, she must have got it only through her husband. While the Hindu Marriage Act had specifically stated that venereal diseases in a communicable form could be a ground for divorce, it had not said anywhere that HIV-positive condition could be a ground for dissolution of a marriage. The divorce plea of Ravikumar, therefore, is not maintainable, she submitted. However, when the court asked the couple to undergo tests at the Government General Hospital in Chennai, Ravikumar alone complied with the order. His wife refused to undergo any tests voluntarily, despite two directives from the court."}

The antibiotic-resistant strain of gonorrhoea - now considered a superbug - was discovered in Japan two years ago. Experts have warned that the bacteria's effects could match those of AIDS. \"This might be a lot worse than AIDS in the short run because the bacteria is more aggressive and will affect more people quickly,\" said Alan Christianson, a doctor of naturopathic medicine. Even though nearly 30 million people have died from AIDS related causes worldwide, Christianson believes the effect of the gonorrhoea bacteria is more direct, 'CNBC News' reported. \"Getting gonorrhoea from this strain might put someone into septic shock and death in a matter of days. This is very dangerous,\" Christianson said. \"It's an emergency situation. As time moves on, it's getting more hazardous,\" said William Smith, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. This gonorrhoea strain, HO41, was discovered in Japan two years ago in a 31-year-old female sex worker who had been screened in 2009. Since it resists current antibiotic treatment, the strain has been placed in the superbug category with other resistant bacteria, such as MRSA and CRE. These superbugs kill about half the people they attack, and nearly one in 20 hospital patients become infected with one, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though no deaths from HO41 have been reported, efforts to combat it must continue, Smith said. \"We have to keep beating the drum on this. The potential for disaster is great,\" he said."}

To begin with, 150 buses operated both by the government and private players in Palakkad, Thrissur and Pathanamthitta districts would run the campaign against HIV. The KSACS selected the three districts to rollout the first phase of the awareness drive due to the high prevalence of HIV. \"This is the first time we would be engaging the public transport system to spread the message against HIV,'' said a KSACS official. The 150 buses would be carrying messages by actor Mohanlal, the brand ambassador of the society. \"The messages will be in different languages so it will help educate people from outside the state,'' said the official. He added that the society would enter into a six-month contract with bus operators in the three districts, and would be extended after reviewing its impact. The KSACS would later extend the campaign in phases to other districts. A sexual health intervention project being carried out in seven districts, and the preliminary findings have revealed high-risk groups among migrant labourers. As many as 11 cases were found positive in Kasaragod alone a year ago. The finding acted as an eye-opener and authorities have been mulling over conducting an exhaustive study and screening of migrants to bring out the real picture. \"The migrants' level of awareness should be improved. We are finding it difficult to reach out to them due to language barriers. Hence we hope that this new mode of campaign could bridge the gap,'' said the official. The KSACS has also initiated talks with the southern railway to replicate the same on trains plying in the state. The society has already been running a campaign on blood donation on trains. Besides buses and trains, the KSACS also has plans to use government establishments in the state to spread awareness on HIV."}

In 2005, the 43-year-old autorickshaw driver from Thane was diagnosed as HIV positive, and two years ago, he was also diagnosed with a kidney failure. What ensued was months of suffering. Even as Ashok had to be put on dialysis, none of his family members would come forward to donate a kidney as he was HIV positive. \"Everybody was apprehensive about his condition. We did not even know that giving an organ to him would not affect our health,\" said Ashok's brother, Surya (name changed). \"Finally, I decided to donate my kidney to him,\" said his 53-year-old brother. But when this decision was made, it turned out that Surya could not give his brother the kidney after all. While Ashok's blood group was A negative, Surya's was B positive. It was then that the brothers registered for a kidney swap at the Apex Swap Transplant Registry (ASTR)-a government authorisation committee that provides a platform for kidney patients to find donors with matching blood groups in return of a donor of their own. \"Even within the ASTR, two other families refused to go for the kidney swap with the Damji brothers as Ashok was HIV positive. We were able to convince one couple, who said that it did not matter who they were giving the kidney to, as long as the donor giving the kidney to them was healthy,\" said Dr Rajesh Kumar, who conducted the swap transplants at L H Hiranandani Hospital on May 9. Nagina and Mahendra Singh, the couple who were in need of a kidney, were happy that the swap worked out well. \"When the doctor explained the situation to us, we understood that the HIV infection was not going to affect us. There was thus, no reason for us to refuse the swap,\" said Mahendra, who had also been on dialysis, but could not get a transplant as his blood group was B positive and his wife's was A positive. \"It was the first kidney swap for an HIV positive patient in the city,\" said Dr Kumar, adding that the complications of a transplant increase in such patients. \"The success rate is about 5% less in an HIV patient than a normal patient, as the risk of infection is more. Also, the drug interaction between the transplant medicine and the anti-retroviral therapy drugs also create complications,\" Dr Kumar added. Both Ashok and Mahendra are well on their way to recovery, while the donors have already been discharged from the hospital."}

After three days of treatment, she lost consciousness and had to be admitted to a hospital, to be diagnosed with deadly 'hepatitis-B'. Her liver had developed cirrhosis and liver transplant was the only remedy. Her parents could hardly afford the costly transplant, and she died on seventh day in the hospital. According to WHO stats, two billion people worldwide have been infected with hepatitis-B virus and about 6 lakh people die every year as a result of hepatitis-B infection. In India, experts say, at least 5% people suffer from hepatitis-B. Hepatitis-B, or the inflammation of liver, is of two types. In the case of acute hepatitis-B, the person's immune system may get rid of it within a period of time. However, the patient is capable of transmitting it to other patients. 'Chronic' hepatitis-B may be a warrant to death if liver becomes cancerous and a liver transplant is not done, said PMCH's medicine HoD Dr J K L Das. The quirky fact about 'carrier' hepatitis is that it remains asymptomatic. \"You may live with it without knowing about it. Until and unless a hepatitis-B test is done or a serious liver ailment occurs, a patient may not come to know about it,\" gastroenterologist Dr BK Chaudhary said and added it might be too late by that time. Jaundice, loss of appetite, vomiting and nausea are common symptoms of hepatitis-B. If anybody is suffering from jaundice, the doctor must get him tested for hepatitis-B. It is also transmitted from mother to child. So doctors advise every pregnant woman to get a hepatitis-B test done. Hepatitis-B is a blood-borne disease. Like HIV, it gets transmitted through sexual intercourse, individual's blood/saliva or reused needles. Unlike hepatitis-A and E, it does not spread through contaminated food or water. Hepatitis-B, which is 50-100 times more infectious than HIV-AIDS, is preventable. \"If a proper vaccination course is given to someone, people develop immunity towards it,\" said Dr Diwakar Tejaswi. There is no age bar to get vaccinated. Normally, one dose of the vaccine costs Rs 200 at private hospitals. Doctors admit vaccination may not develop proper immunity. \"If the vaccine is not of good quality, it may not be of help. It is, therefore, better to get antibodies tested after taking the course of vaccines,\" said another doctor."}

It was the city's first ever edition of the International AIDS Candlelight Memorial (IACM ). This Sunday evening on May 19, 2013, people from all walks of life will participate in the memorial service, which falls on the third Sunday of May. It is a day dedicated to the memory of those lost to HIV and AIDS. The lighting of the candle is an important part of the ritual. \"What's the use of lighting a candle?\" scoffed a sit- at- the- computer smart-aleck-Facebook troll. On that hot summer night of 2001, the 'official' HIV figures in Bihar stood at 35 infected and 1 death. That night, in the glow of the red candles, it was revealed that some 900 people had tested positive during the past five years, and this was with data from just Sens' Lab and Kurji Holy Family Hospital. This news appeared widely in the local press. It, of course, embarrassed the Bihar State AIDS Control Society (BSACS) people who had also come to the 'show', carrying a large BSACS banner. Those red candles flickering in the summer breeze challenged the opaque darkness of ignorance and apathy. A stunned BSACS spokesperson could only say, \"These are not government figures. We don't include data from private hospitals.\" The lameness of the retort was self-evident. As a direct consequence, under the leadership of CK Anil, BSACS began improving services and surveillance. When the next IACM was held a year later, BSACS reporting had greatly improved, voluntary counselling and testing centres were being set up, and 1097 HIV/AIDS helplines had been set up. In 2002, the candles brought to light the issues of silence and stigma. They brought to the fore two things: one, that HIV infections were closer to middle class Bihar than reported, and two, that the obsolete Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was obstructing the battle against HIV and AIDS. Giving the keynote address was a young Bihar-born activist lawyer named Aditya Bandhopadhyay, who was defending the workers of the Naz Foundation International (NFI) in Lucknow, who had been arrested for 'abetting unnatural offences' by distributing condoms and running a sexual health and AIDS prevention centre for non-heterosexual males. 'Integration', one of Kolkata's pioneering Queer Rights groups, performed at the Memorial. It was this year that a symbolic 'Reading of the Names' was started: speaking the names of people lost to HIV and AIDS. The list had some 25 names, people lost to AIDS who were close to the participants and organizers. In 2003, the Memorial had its first transgender guest of honour, Lallan Hijra, who introduced into the Bihar HIV AIDS narrative the voices of the marginalized. She spoke of the trauma of accessing medical services of any kind; how 'hijras' were generally treated like dirt by doctors and nurses alike. She said if Bihar opened its eyes to the fact that transgenders would always be there, and let them access education and skills in peace, they wouldn't be a community forced to dance and beg and be vulnerable to HIV and AIDS. Arriving that day to light the Memorial candle were Arif Jafar and Shivananda Khan. Arif Jafar was the person arrested in the NFI Lucknow case, and he spoke of how media insensitivity and sensationalism coupled with misuse of Section 377 by the police would only cripple society further. The candles also shone on another dark corner, the fate of street children. And so on, year after year, aware and concerned citizens come to light candles in the memory of those lost to HIV and AIDS. We have lit them when Bihar continued to be in denial, hiding under the cloak of being a 'low incidence state', ignoring the stark reality of high migration of labour and the non-availability of testing at district level. We lighted them as realization dawned that Bihar was a 'vulnerable state'. Over the years we have lit candles with sadness as the people lost to AIDS have become familiar, and we have lit them with hope as people with HIV have gained the courage to come out of the darkness of anonymity and speak for themselves. Tonight the candles glow to remind us that HIV is no longer a ticket to death, if only the required ART treatment is made accessible and affordable. They glow to announce that since 2012, we can claim that some 95 children out of every 100 are born HIV free to infected mothers, thanks to the ART regimen for pregnant HIV positive women. They will glow to dispel the myth that HIV is spread through a razor blade. They also light up the fact that there are more than 55,000 HIV positive children, women and men recorded so far in Bihar, and most still face discrimination and stigma. That is why every candle that flickers in the wind is so very important."}

A team of researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine have announced that they have peeled open HIV's outer coating and discovered 4-million-atom structure inside the protein shell. The findings, researchers say will ultimately lead the way to fending off an often-changing virus that has been very hard to conquer. It's been 30 years since the AIDS epidemic spread to every corner of the world killing nearly 30 million people, infecting more than 60 million. There is still no vaccine or cure for it Scientists say developing an effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection is one of the most daunting challenges ever faced. One of the main reason for this is that HIV is an incredibly elusive virus. HIV is among the most mutating viruses. Scientists have long struggled to decipher how the HIV capsid shell is chemically put together. Senior author Peijun Zhang, department of structural biology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine said, \"The capsid is critically important for HIV replication, so knowing its structure in detail could lead us to new drugs that can treat or prevent the infection,\" she said. \"This approach has the potential to be a powerful alternative to our current HIV therapies, which work by targeting certain enzymes, but drug resistance is an enormous challenge due to the virus' high mutation rate.\" Previous research has shown that the cone-shaped shell is composed of identical capsid proteins linked together in a complex lattice. But the shell is non-uniform and asymmetrical; uncertainty remained about the exact number of proteins involved and how the hexagons of six protein subunits and pentagons of five subunits are joined. Standard structural biology methods to decipher the molecular architecture were insufficient because they rely on averaged data, collected on samples of pieces of the highly variable capsid to identify how these pieces tend to go together. \"The capsid is very sensitive to mutation, so if we can disrupt those interfaces, we could interfere with capsid function,\" Dr Zhang said. \"The capsid has to remain intact to protect the HIV genome and get it into the human cell, but once inside it has to come apart to release its content so that the virus can replicate. Developing drugs that cause capsid dysfunction by preventing its assembly or disassembly might stop the virus from reproducing.\" \"By using a combination of experimental and computational approaches, this team of investigators has produced a clearer picture of the structure of HIV's protective covering,\" said the National Institutes of Health's Michael Sakalian. \"The new structural details may reveal vulnerabilities that could be exploited by future therapeutics.\""}

Dr Eric P Goosby, the US Global AIDS Coordinator, said that it would \"truly help save lives\" and that he was prepared to use funds from the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief for it. For a heterosexual man in countries where Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is common, being circumcised lowers the chance of contracting HIV or getting infected by the virus by about 60 per cent, according to the report.

The scheme was launched by the department of health and family welfare and Karnataka State Aids Prevention Society (KSAPS) in January 2013. Before the launch of this scheme, many poor HIV patients, mainly those residing in rural areas, did not visit ART centres regularly for treatment as they couldn\u2019t afford the travel fare from their homes to the centres. Six ART centres are situated in different parts of DK district, including two centres in Mangalore city. Dr Kishore Kumar, DK district AIDS control officer, told TOI that an average of 60 HIV patients visit each ART centre a day for treatment. There are 1,600 patients registered in ART centres which provide free treatment, he said. Before the travel fare reimbursement fee scheme was introduced, around 20 patients were skipping their regular visits to ART centres every day. But in the past few months, this number has come down to three, he added. \u201cLast year, when we contacted patients about why they weren\u2019t visiting ART centres, they\u2019d say they cannot afford the travel expense,\u201d said Dr Kishore. He said patients who travel from rural areas to ART centres are reimbursed 80 paisa per kilometre to and fro, while patients within city limits are given Rs 40. After undergoing treatment, patients\u2019 travel expenses are reimbursed at the ART centres. Expenses are also reimbursed for one caretaker who accompanies any HIV patients under 10 years or over 60 years of age, said Dr Kishore. Urging patients to make use of the scheme and free treatment, he said they have to visit the centres once a month. Missing out on a monthly visit is dangerous as it could lead to resistance towards the drug.

A case of unnatural death was registered and the body sent for autopsy. The patient from Narkeldanga was detected HIV-positive a couple of years ago. For the past eight months, he was undergoing Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) at Medical College and Hospital Calcutta. But because of his irregular visits to the hospital for the therapy, his CD4 count dropped drastically following which he was rushed to the medical college last month. The man was taken home after he became stable and admitted to STM two weeks back since he had become anaemic and was suffering from bouts of diarrhoea. The victim's family members said that he would often skip medicines and needed constant monitoring. His son was hence staying with him so that he could be looked after properly. According to the patient's son, he had fed him and given him all necessary medicines before putting him to sleep around 12 midnight. The son also slept thereafter. At 4.30am, he was woken up by a groaning sound and found his father lying on the floor with blood all around. His abdomen was split open and the intestines visible. A knife brought by the son to cut fruits was used to cut open the abdomen, said police. \"Though the doctors attended to him immediately, the patient couldn't be revived as he had lost a lot of blood and the injury was grievous. He succumbed to the injury an hour later,\" said Dr Pradip Kumar Kundu, STM medical superintendent and vice principal. The patient was depressed and suffering from dementia, said doctors.

A 46-year-old patient was found dead under mysterious circumstances at his hospital cabin in School of Tropical Medicine (STM) on Thursday morning. Though it is suspected as a case of suicide, police has registered a case of unnatural death and sent the body for post mortem. The HIV positive patient from Narkeldanga was getting treatment for a cabin at STM. His son too stayed with him at the same cabin to look after him. On hearing someone groaning in pain at the wee hours the son woke up to find his father lying on the floor in a pool of blood. He alerted the nurses on duty who called in the medical officer. Despite giving all emergency medical attention, the man succumbed to the injury. According to the son, he has fed his father and given all medications before putting him to sleep around 12 midnight. The son also slept after that. Around 4.30 am he was awakened by the sound of groaning. He woke up to find his father on the floor will blood all around. To the shock of the doctors who rushed in they found the abdomen of the patient slit deep and wide and his intestine had popped out. \"He was attended immediately by our doctors. But the patient had lost so much of blood and the injury was so grievous that he could not revived. He succumbed to the injury about an hour later,\" said Dr Pradip Kumar Kundu, STM medical superintendent and vice principal. The patient was detected HIV positive a couple of years ago. He was on ART drugs for about eight months from Medical College and Hospital Calcutta. But due to his irregularities in going for the ART his CD 4 count had come down drastically as a result he was rushed to the said hospital about a month ago. He was then discharged after being treated for about a week. His family brought him to STM two weeks ago as he had become anaemic and suffered from bouts of diarrhoea. Family members said that the patient would skip medications if he was not monitored by someone. That is how his son stayed with him in the hospital to look after him. Doctors treating him also said that the patient was depressed and was also suffering from dementia. His condition had started improving slightly in the past one week. A knife brought by the son to cut fruit for the patient was used to cut open the abdomen of the patient.

Expressing relief that Arunachal Pradesh is one of the least affected state in the country by the menace, Tuki, however, cautioned that the state cannot afford to become complacent as HIV/AIDS is a 'ticking time bomb' upon which one cannot sit idle. He lauded the efforts put in by the Arunachal Pradesh State AIDS Control Society for its crusade against the disease through various multi-media tools especially targeting the youth population, which is the most vulnerable section of the society. For the Society to work more effectively he sought support from the central government and organizations working in this field and assured full cooperation from the state government. Tuki also advised policy makers and planners in the campaign against HIV/AIDS to keep in mind the sensibilities of tribal communities. \"As the crusade against HIV/AIDS does not include only medical treatment and preventive measures but also involves socio-psychological and emotional aspects, the uniqueness of tribal mentality and tradition may be kept in mind,\" he suggested.

A team of researchers from YRG Care in Chennai, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brown, Yale and Harvard universities in the US has determined that providing universal HIV testing every five years would be a cost-effective approach to managing the epidemic. The finding was published on Tuesday in the journal PLoS One. Testing the general population just once would cost $1,100 (approx 65,000) per year of life saved (YLS) in the general population, and $800 (47,000) per YLS among high-risk groups. Testing the population every five years would cost $1,900 (1.1lakh) per YLS saved in for the general public, and $1,300 (76,000) per YLS among high-risk groups. Researchers said the main benefit of national testing would be getting more people to learn they are positive and therefore to seek effective care. A secondary benefit would be to curb transmission of the virus. According to the team, the main results are projections of the dollar cost per year of extended life. The World Health Organization\u2019s standard for cost effectiveness is an expenditure that is less than three times the per capita GDP of a country. In India in 2010, per capita GDP was $1,300. A programme is therefore cost-effective in India if the expense is less than $3,900 (2.2lakh) to save a year of someone\u2019s life. They calculated that modern antiretroviral therapies can give HIV-positive people a normal lifespan. In India, which has a thriving generic pharmaceutical sector, first-line therapy costs only $8.61 (500) a month. HIV tests cost only $3.33 (195). The team coded several other parameters into the model including what percentage of people would refuse the test (18%), how many patients who test positive would get care (50%), the prevalence of HIV in the population (0.29%) and others. Jessica Becker of Yale University said, \u201cWe were able to show that even if you increase the cost of HIV treatment and care significantly, testing this frequently was reasonable.\u201d Co-author Dr Soumya Swaminathan, director of the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis in Chennai, said the projections will help the country in its battle with the epidemic. \u201cAs India moves ahead in its HIV prevention activities and aims for zero new infections, expanding testing will be a priority and this analysis should help policymakers make the best decisions,\u201d she said."}

Even parents' death due to AIDS is an obstacle for marriage as was experienced by a young woman in Sivaganga district. After her bridegroom backed off from marrying her a week before the wedding, the woman has now filed a complaint with the police. In defence, the bridegroom has approached the court seeking immunity from police intervention. Marriage between P Sevugan, 38, of Sudanipatti and K Anbuselvi of Vanjinipatti in Sivagangai district has been scheduled for June 19 at Muraiyur Sri Meenakshi Amman Sokkanathar temple. The invite cards were also printed and other arrangements were on, when Sevugan decided to call off the alliance after hearing that Anbuselvi's parents had died of AIDS. Even though, Anbuselvi showed him medical report that gave her clean chit with regard to HIV, Sevugan remained adamant. Following it, she filed a complaint before the Thiruppathur all-women police station on June 5 seeking action against the groom. She stated that after the death of her parents, she is living with her grandmother and her younger brother. Despite being a labourer, she managed to purchase jewels and home appliances worth Rs 4 lakh for the marriage. Inspector M Jayanthi said that her planned wedding was rescinded by the groom due to HIV stigma. Police even sent Anbuselvi to a private hospital to undergo HIV test which confirmed that she is not affected with HIV, she said. After her petition, Sevugan has now approached the high court bench, seeking interim injunction restraining the all-women police from insisting him to marry the girl. In his petition he contended that after he knew that her parents' death was due to AIDS, he had confirmed the matter with Anbuselvi's relatives. Thereafter, he refused to marry her and his decision was accepted by her relatives, he said. When the writ petition came up before Justice N Kirubakaran, notice was ordered to be issued to the superintendent of police, Sivagangai, all-women police station and Anbuselvi.

Drug users are one of the top three high-risk populations due to sharing of infected needles. The first trial to assess whether preventive treatment with HIV drugs could affect rates of infection in people who inject drugs has found that daily tablets of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir), an anti-retroviral drug, reduced HIV incidence by nearly half (48.9%) compared to a placebo, according to results published in the medical journal The Lancet. A team of researchers led by Kachit Choopanya and Michael Martin, chief of clinical research for Thailand's ministry of public health, recruited over 2,400 participants at 17 drug treatment clinics in Thailand. Around half of the participants were assigned a daily oral dose of tenofovir, while the rest were given a placebo. All trial participants were offered monthly HIV testing and risk-reduction counseling and services, plus access to drug rehabilitation treatment. Participants were followed for an average of four years. Overall, 17 participants in the tenofovir group became infected with HIV, compared to 33 in the placebo group, indicating a reduction in HIV risk by 48.9%. Further analysis showed that the protective effect of the antivirals was highest where participants adhered closely to the prescribed regime, reaching more than 70% in this subgroup. Previous studies have established that pre-exposure prophylaxis effectively reduces sexual transmission of HIV in both heterosexual couples and men who have sex with men, as well as reducing mother to child transmission of HIV."}

The union ministry for health and the family welfare department along with the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) formed an expert committee to look into the issue. This was on the basis of a Gujarat High Court order passed on November 8 last year in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) demanding that the PCR test or the Nucleic Acid Amblification Test (NAAT) should be made mandatory in lieu of Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for detection of HIV infection. The PIL argued that the PCR test reduces the 'window period,' that is, the time period the body takes to produce antibodies in response to HIV infection, also the time period during which the HIV virus is undetectable. The committee was asked to recommend the extent to which PCR test should be made mandatory at all licensed blood banks. It submitted its report on Thursday with conclusions and recommendations. The committee has concluded that the NAAT can at best be an add-on test of HIV screening along with routine mandated antibody screening tests by immunoassay. NAAT is technically demanding and our blood banks are not adequately equipped to carry it out for routine purposes. It also said that NAAT assays may not provide zero risk for acquiring transfusion transmitted infections (TTI) as it does not completely eliminate the window period. After listing out eight reasons why PCR cannot be made mandatory in India, the experts recommended that it should not be made compulsory for all blood banks, since the high turnaround time in screening donated blood may lead to a delay in utilization and may compromise accessibility of blood and blood components. Moreover, its introduction would necessitate amendment in the regulatory framework. The expert group further opined that since there is insufficient data on the additional yield of TTI viral markers as well as operational and technical feasibility in India, selected centres may be identified to conduct this test. A further hearing on this issue will be held next Thursday."}

This extensive drive has been launched after five districts of UP including Allahabad, Mau, Deoria, Etawah and Banda were placed under 'category A' in terms of migration of HIV/AIDS infected persons. Subsequently NACO is carrying out a special campaign in identified villages between June 13 and 27. NACO has also decided to carry out fourth phase of AIDS control programme in UP from October this year.

Dr Rohit Pandey, district programme manager, AIDS programme said that special camps are being held in 100 identified villages from June 13 to 27 while mass awareness camps in the same villages would be held between June 20 and July 4, 2013. He added that five villages each from 20 blocks of the district have been selected for awareness and educational progammes wherein migrants are being apprised about it too. Even as the officials will be collecting data of number patients from all 20 blocks of the district, they will also be carrying out an intensive drive to check the health status of migrants and identify their locations with an aim to offer them counseling and treatment. Meanwhile, they will also be conducting studies regarding the migration pattern and prevalence of HIV. As far as route of infection and transmission categories are concerned, in 85.3 per cent cases, the disease spreads due to unsafe sexual contact, while 3.80 per cent, 2.05 per cent, 3.34 per cent and 6.46 per cent cases are due to prenatal transmission, blood transfusion, injectable drug users respectively. Dr Shahi claimed under the directives of NACO and UPACS, district health authorities will be identifying those migrant labourers, truckers and homosexuals in the district as they are more vulnerable to the disease.

The court said it was \"absurd'' for him to say it was in the interest of his wife to go in for early detection. Justice Roshan Dalvi heard a petition by Santa Cruz resident Joel D'Souza (name changed), who met Joan (name changed) through a marriage bureau. Both professionals, they married on December 26, 2009. In June 2010, Joan had typhoid and went to her mother's place nearby. Thereafter, Joel stopped calling or receiving her calls. On July 7, 2010, he took her call but told her he would not take her back, without explanation. The medical test report of July 7, 2010 confirmed Joan was cured of typhoid and tests included for HIV antibodies. On July 10, 2010, on reaching her matrimonial home, she found Joel had changed the lock. On October 22, 2010, he filed for divorce alleging impotency/non-consummation of marriage and cruelty. Pending the petition, on March 16, 2011 Joel filed an application praying for direction to Joan to undergo HIV, TB and hepatitis tests along with tests for impotency/failure to consummate the marriage as he suspected she was HIV positive. In his application before the FC, Joel gave many reasons, including fever, tiredness, body ache, dry cough, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and headache. He said Joan had a bloated abdomen although her face, hands and legs were very thin and due to this she wore long outfits. \"On an official website of HIV, it is documented that HIV is medically caused due to accumulation of fat in the stomach,'' he stated. He said she spoke in her sleep using the words 'HIV' and 'AIDS' and mentioned 'Jack Dorsan', who he found on the Internet was in the prostitution business. He said his wife had stored Dorsan's telephone number and spoke to him on the day of their wedding. He said she applied lip balm five to six times a day \"as the best treatment for Herpes Simplex Virus is keeping the lips moist\". Joan said Joel's suspicion was \"reckless, wild and cruel'' and he himself needed treatment. The FC on May 16, 2012 rejected his application with costs saying, however strong his suspicion, he had to prove the allegations by furnishing evidence so that the court can grant him relief. Joel moved the high court in October 2012. Joan's advocate Mini Mathew argued that the July 7, 2010 report confirming she was cured of typhoid was sufficient to hold that it was not necessary to send her for an HIV test. She said Joel had been spreading rumours about her. \"These allegations are stigmatizing. Her reputation is ruined,'' she said. Joel's advocate Uday Warunjikar said, \"He caught his wife taking HIV medicines. If she is not suffering from HIV, why is she afraid of the test?'' he asked. Justice Dalvi remarked, \"I doubt the marriage can be reconciled. Both sides must move for an amicable settlement.'' She added, \"Why don't you throw her out in a little respectable way? It will boomerang on you.''"}

Residents of Mangaldoi staged a blockade on NH-52 against the state health department and disrupted traffic for several hours. Security forces resorted to lathi charge to clear the highway. Hospital authorities said they only know of two victims, who contracted the infection from the donor. But activist and State AIDS Control Society employee Jahnavi Goswami said five people had been infected and she feared that there could be more."}

Her future husband's pale looks were explained by his family as the consequences of tuberculosis. Though her father gave Varsha the option of breaking off the engagement, she did not as she had the future of her three younger sisters in mind. After the marriage, the parents-in-law moved to another city and Varsha had to drop out of her MSc class to take care of hubby who kept ill. In a year, they were blessed with a daughter. The little one, too, started remaining ill. Their world tumbled when they discovered that the cause was HIV which all three of them were now affected with. However, Varsha took this in her stride, stood by her husband and despite the in-laws holding her responsible for this fate, worked towards rebuilding her lives. For 15 years, she bore all abuses from her husband and his family silently. It was only after her teenaged daughter committed suicide that she decided to stand up against their cruelties. Varsha is not alone in this tragic situation, several women who have contracted the virus from their husbands have similar stories to tell. Many of these women have come forward to share their stories on the platform of Positive Women's Network, an NGO founded by Varsha. \"Among the women with HIV-AIDS in India, at least 65% have got the disease from their husbands. Most of the time, the men know about their HIV-positive status but do not reveal it to their partners for a long time after getting married,\" says Varsha who is also a counsellor at the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) centre located at the Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital. For Madhavi Ambatkar, the president of the network's Hingoli branch, it was a double shock as discovering her HIV-positive status also revealed her husband's dalliances. \"Some advertisements on television spoke about the symptoms of AIDS. I got myself checked and found I had the disease. Scared, I took my 4-year-old son for the test. Fortunately, he tested negative,\" she recalled. A confrontation with her husband revealed that he had been with other women one of whom may have passed on the disease to him. He showed no regret and asked Madhavi to be glad that their son did not have the virus. Later, he deserted them and began living with another woman. Madhavi's biggest concern today is that her former husband doesn't seem interested in his son's education or future. \"I worry what will happen to my child when I am not around,\" she says. In another typical case, a wife got to know about her positive status when she was being tested for HIV during her pregnancy. Her husband called her characterless and filed for a divorce immediately. \"While it may be difficult to tell which of the two spouses contracted the disease first, in Indian context, there are more chances of the husband being responsible. While some of them accept their mistake, most do not,\" said activist Anand Chandrani. Most of the wives, though, adjust and live with the situation as they don't have a social security if they were to leave their husbands, he added. \"In some cases, there parents don't take them in. Living alone with the virus is also a scary prospect,\" he said. Chandrani says that there are examples of women who have defied these social norms. \"But they are few and far between,\" he says. Another activist Samir Shinde says that it is safe that on one hand we talk about women empowerment in the 21{+s}{+t} century and on the other we have women who don't really have a choice to exercise. \"Even in today's modern society, our 'emancipated' women are bound by several societal shackles. We have together brought in a culture where they are supposed to suffer in silence, whatever trials they are put to. Complete emancipation of women will be possible when they are really allowed to make an informed choice and speak their minds. They have to be taught to give their needs and their own lives as much importance as they give to that of their families,\" he said."}

Doctors said it is clear now that the child has been infected through blood transfusion. \"It is now proved beyond doubt that the complainants are the biological parents of the baby,\" District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) M Gopi Naik told TOI on Sunday. The controversy has been raging since the past four months when the child was found to be HIV positive at a private hospital where she had been admitted for treatment of pneumonia. Doctors there had used blood from a local blood bank for transfusion when the condition of the child turned critical . But when the baby tested positive for AIDS a week later, the shocked parents approached the police and district authorities. The child was then shifted to the Government General Hospital (GGH ) for treatment and cops registered cases against the doctors, promoting several from the medical fraternity to protest. Doctors at the private hospital and officials at the blood bank refuted any culpability. Later, the district collector set up a committee, including DHMP Gopi Naik, which went through the records at the private hospital and blood bank . Reports at the time of the child's birth showed her to be HIV negative. The parents as well as the blood donor, who was traced after the controversy erupted, also tested negative. Meanwhile, the mystery deepened when GGH superintendent Mohan Rao found the records of the child tampered with, marking the baby as HIV positive at the time of birth itself. The government hospital authorities raised suspicion that it was the handiwork of the private hospital management in order to wash their hands off the issue. At this stage, the Indian Medical Association raised doubts whether the parents had adopted the child and sent their samples for a DNA test. Even before the paternity test report came, the district collector handed over the inquiry to the AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS ) . APSACS joint director Jayachandra Reddy, who conducted an in-camera inquiry with the medical officers, GGH staff and met collector Suresh Kumar on Saturday, said he would submit a report shortly."}

Gogoi also announced Rs 5 lakh each for the HIV-infected persons and said that the government would take bear the medical expenses of the victims. BJP, meanwhile, demanded criminal proceedings against the three officials suspended in the case. Mangaldai MP and former BJP president Romen Deka said here on Monday, \"Mere suspension of the officials and conducting an inquiry into the matter will not suffice. It's a criminal offence and criminal proceedings have to be initiated against the officials and staff for neglecting their duties.\" On Sunday, the hospital's blood bank in-charge Jiten Saharia and laboratory technicians Ranjit Chandra Deka and Padmadhar Baruah were suspended for negligence of duty. Deka demanded that government should conduct a survey on recipients of blood from the hospital in the district to ascertain the number of people infected with HIV. \"Blood banks and nursing homes are mushrooming in the state. The government should put in place a stringent monitoring mechanism so that such an incident is not repeated,\" he said. The state government has already instituted a one-man commission headed by additional chief secretary P P Varma to probe into the incident. The commission will submit the report within a month. Varma is likely to visit the civil hospital on Tuesday. At least five persons allegedly contracted HIV after they were transfused with blood from an infected donor at the Mangaldai hospital. But, health and family welfare minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told mediapersons that only three persons were infected with HIV. After a team of doctors from the health department submitted its report, Sarma said that of the three, one was a man and two were women. Sarma informed that one of the women took blood from three donors. He also said that blood of all three donors has not yet been tested to ascertain who among them is HIV positive. He said the government would make it mandatory for all blood banks to install double blood-testing centres under close-circuit television surveillance. He said that his department is also thinking of providing two percent job reservations in third and fourth grade posts for the victims of the incident in government hospitals. Meanwhile, a 12-hour Mangaldai bandh called by BJP and Asomiya Yuva Macha completely paralyzed life in the district."}

The treatment is held up for six months as most government centres do not have viral load testing kits. kits are supplied through National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) that buys it from Roche Diagnostics India Ltd (RDIL). RDIL has stopped the supply since January 2013 as NACO failed to make payments worth Rs 2 crore. As many as 100 patients of second line of antiretroviral therapy (ART) from Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in city have been asked to wait until the kits arrive. These are not just HIV positive patients. They are patients on whom the first line of ART has failed and need second line regime. The only centre in Maharashtra that tests the viral load of patients (actual amount of HIV in patient's blood), Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai, does not have the kits since January. All government medical colleges with second line of ART facility send their patients to Grant Medical College and J J Hospital in Mumbai which collects the blood and sends sample to Kasturba Hospital. When TOI tried to contact the authorities at J J as well as Kasturba hospitals, everyone deflected the queries to someone else. TOI then contacted director of Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) Prakash Sabde who demanded a formal questionnaire through mail. Even after being sent one, he did not respond to email and repeated requests. A reliable source in NACO, Delhi, clarified that actually kits were available. It is the reagents required for tests that are not. NACO buys them from RDIL but has not made payment for the past two years. Strangely, reagents are procured for NACO through RITES, a subsidiary of Indian railways. \"We can't even buy them from other agencies as the testing machines are bought from RDIL and come with a rider that the user has to buy the reagents from the same company. The payment was stopped since documentation by vendor was not proper. Now we have made some part payments, so RDIL has resumed supply from April-May. It will be some time before each centre gets supplies,\" said the source. Meanwhile, senior medical officer of ART centre at GMCH Dr Megha Navade said the waiting list was continuing to swell. The problem was not limited just to GMCH. Pune and Aurangabad colleges which were the only other two centres with second line of ART facility too were facing the same problem. \"We have written to authorities in Mumbai many times but we are told not to send patients until kits arrive,\" she said. No aid for aids patients * GMCH is only centre for second line of ART treatment in Vidarbha. * Patients whose CD4 count does not increase despite regular medication with first line of drugs are tested for second line of ART. * Their treatment is put on hold till viral load is assessed. This is done only at Mumbai. Patient's blood cannot be sent to Mumbai. They have to travel to give samples at JJ Hospital. * Such patients are stuck because testing has stopped owing to non-supply of kits/reagents. * Supply stopped because of payment dispute with supplier."}

After going through the report that was submitted in sealed cover, the bench of Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice J B Pardiwala granted two more months to CBI to probe the issue and come up with another report. The HC handed over the investigation from a Gujarat-cadre IPS officer to CBI, expressing dissatisfaction with the manner the probe was conducted till then. The CBI accordingly lodged a fresh FIR against office bearers of the private blood bank and hospital authorities. While transferring the probe, the judges noticed how former investigator IPS Shobha Bhutada had tried to shield local BJP MLA Mahendra Mashroo by merely recording his statement, whereas allegations were mainly targeted against the blood bank that was illegally operating from the civil hospital campus. Mashroo looks after this private blood bank. In 2011, 23 thalassemic kids in Junagadh district were found to have contracted HIV.

DAPCU officials said at least 40% individuals among the target groups of migrant labouers and truckers were not aware of the factors responsible for the spread of AIDS. DAPCU has deputed teams of Meerut, Kanpur, and Lucknow-based folk artists to spread awareness among the target groups. With Allahabad district already classified under 'A' category by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) as far as spread AIDS transmission is concerned, all prevention and care interventions specified by the organization need to be scaled up on a priority basis. Allahabad district has a very large flow of migrants and truckers. It also has a high population of the most vulnerable age group (18-35 years). Under the strategy, two street plays or other events are being held in 60 selected villages with basic health workers motivating villagers to attend the folk artistes' show. Moreover, the artistes are also carrying out counselling and IEC (information, education and communication) sessions for truckers/migrant labouers, who are one of the strongest modes of HIV transmission across the state. Exemplifying the axiom 'think globally, act locally', labourers , once apprised about the factors responsible behind the deadly disease, promise folk artists that they would do their bit in spreading awareness on AIDS on their part and ensure that each and every villager broadly know how the incurable disease is transmitted. A total of 60 spots have been identified and would be covered till June 27. DAPCU's nodal officer Dr OP Shahi points out, \"When it comes to dispelling myths about factors behind transmission of HIV/AIDS and control measures, folk show has always proved to be a hit for spreading awareness especially among rural masses.\" Be it the elderly or teenager, all were briefed about the causes that spread the deadly disease. \"More stress is being made on villages which are sensitive in terms of transmission of hiv or High risk group people are staying\". Dr Shahi said, \"We are also organizing counselling sessions promptly with an aim to check the transmission of the deadly disease.\" He added that under directives of NACO and UP State AIDS Control Society (UPSACS), more stress has been laid in areas where high-risk groups like female sex workers (FSW) and injecting drug users (IDUs) stay and these areas have been taken under the scanner. Authorities have already recommended implementation of the link workers programme in Category A and B districts of the country in a phased manner, more stress has been paid to Allahabad district, as its boundary connects it with seven other districts. The fact is that apart from migrant labourers, truckers and MSM (men having sex with men) were being identified in the district as they were most responsible for and vulnerable to spread of the deadly disease. Efforts are also underway to identify them so that they could be offered best possible treatment and counselling. During surveys, it has come to notice that victims due to various reasons including social stigma, do not come forward and reel under depression, said Dr Shahi."}

What is most worrying is the psychological trauma they go through as they deal with the disease at such young age. According to a study taken up by the social work department of Andhra University (AU), nearly 60% of the HIV affected children surveyed were found to be grappling with psychological problems. The study was done in three districts with the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS __ Krishna (2.7% of the population have HIV), Kadapa and Karimnagar (both with 1.7 % prevalence rate). \"There are around 1.5 lakh such 'AIDS orphans' in the state, according to the AP State Aids Control Society (Apsacs),\" said research scholar Abraham Mutluri, who is doing the three-year-long study under the guidance of department head Prof ABSV Ranga Rao. \"However, there is no specific government home or institute for such children and the stigma associated with the disease makes it all the more difficult for the kids to find shelter, though in most cases NGOs give them shelter in some homes while some find a place with relatives or neighbours,\" said Mutluri. As many as 316 children in the 8-18 years age group in the three districts were selected for the study that is to be completed in August and is the first assessment of the condition of such children in the state. Of these, around 40% are HIV infected, the study showed. Besides, more than 60% of the kids are depressed, lonely, have extreme mood variations or show signs of some kind of psychological disorder, said the researcher. \"Sadly, in the ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centres, where the kids get free treatment, there are hardly any child psychologists to counsel them individually. The group counselling is inadequate,\" said Mutluri. Most of the kids are from poor families, where the father had been a trucker or migrant worker. \"In 65% of the cases, the widowed mothers migrate to parental homes to avoid the stigma and are forced to sell property for a paltry sum. The education of the children also suffers and many of them become dropouts,\" he said. In some cases, especially if one child is HIV positive, the siblings are separated and one of them is sent to a hostel while the other is taken by some relative, informed Prof Rao. All such changes affects the children psychologically which needs to be addressed."}

Rajasthan is a low HIV/AIDS prevalence state but the slight increase in prevalence of people living with HIV/AIDS has increased worries for the RSACS and NACO.

He said that they would do \"cross-learning\" with Karnataka on implementation of programmes. Earlier, in Karnataka, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS was quite high but later they developed a system with NGOs which helped them in decreasing the prevalence of HIV/AIDS.

However, contradicting views of People's hospital doctor, Dr Verma said, \"ART treatment in such condition would be detrimental to patient's health.\" \"Considering that the patient was critical, his condition should have been stabilized, before discharge. As per Supreme Court directive, a hospital cannot refuse treatment to a patient if found HIV positive,\" said Rajpal Shekhawat of MP Positive Network, which campaigns for AIDS patients. After intervention of NGO activists, MP State AIDS Control Society (MPSACS) official arranged for the patient's admission to government Gandhi Medical College (GMC), where he continues to be in critical state."}

Information regarding new guidelines was disseminated among HIV-positive persons by non government organisations at a programme here on Thursday. The guidelines are based on scientific evidence that early initiation of ART can help people with HIV to live longer, healthier lives, and substantially reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others. \"The new recommendations encourage all countries to initiate treatment in adults living with HIV when their specific (CD4) cell count falls to 500 cells per unit or less against the old norm of 350 cells per unit. This is the time the immune system is still strong,\" said Dr BB Rewari from National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). \"The new guidelines offer hope but they will be of use to those in need only when the department responsible for its implementation takes it seriously,\" said Naresh Yadav, President of UP Network of People living with HIV (UPNP+). \"Guidelines cannot save the life of a person, medicines can,\" he added. Naresh also emphasised improving comprehensive and coordinated response to HIV so that the gains of new WHO guidelines can be translated in positive health outcome on the ground. The new recommendations also include providing antiretroviral therapy-irrespective of their CD4 count-to all children with HIV under 5 years of age, all pregnant and breastfeeding women with HIV, and to all HIV-positive couples where one partner is uninfected. The WHO continues to recommend that all people with HIV with active tuberculosis (TB) or with hepatitis B disease receive anti-retroviral therapy regardless of their CD4 count. Another new recommendation is to offer all adults starting to take ART the same daily single fixed-dose combination pill. This combination is easier to take and safer than alternative combinations previously recommended and can be used in adults, pregnant women, adolescents and older children."}

The district administration has, however, adopted a tough stance and deployed police bandobast at the school premises from Saturday. The girls started going to school last week but due to random demonstration by the parents opposing their presence, they were not attending regularly. From Monday, the girls will attend school in the presence of 10 men and women police personnel outside the school. To give a clear message to the protesting parents, a team of district, panchayat and police officials visited the village on Saturday and decided to take help of police. \"We are going to continue the police bandobast till the villagers continue their protest. Many students wish to study in the school and we are making sure that they are not deprived,\" said J A Patel, deputy superintendent of police, Surat. Earlier, district collectorate and health department conveyed to villagers that their protest was out of place and nothing can stop the girls from studying. Several rounds of meetings were held with villagers, majority of whom were convinced. Out of 210 students, parents of only 17 are continuing their protest. \"We have been ordered to make sure that the school should operate. All those who want to study can now go to school and the HIV+ girls will also study in the same school. On Saturday, a group of parents gathered near the school.

However, discrimination by locals and space limitation forced them to shift to a donated accommodation near Amboli, around 10 km away from Surat in April."}

Then four years ago, she was introduced to a health project that helps HIV positive mothers avail medical assistance for themselves and their child. Now Asha is one of the 25 volunteers for the project in Rajasthan's Ajmer district and has facilitated 102 childbirths of HIV positive women in the last four years. The project titled, Reduction of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV in India: Improving access of Positive Women to Public Health Services (PPTCT), was launched in three states \u2014 Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan in 2009. \"The project taught me to speak for myself and stand up for my rights,\" says Asha. Funded through European Union and Christian Aid, the project aims to contribute to the National Aids Control Programme\u2014III's overall goal of halting and reversing the HIV epidemic in India. This was to be achieved by providing non\u2013stigmatized PPTCT services through networks and volunteers. According to Asha, before the PPTCT project, women were neither able to access government health services nor opted for hospital deliveries. After the programme began, there has been a definite increase in both accessing services and hospital deliveries. \"More importantly there has been a drop in the number of children that are born HIV positive,\" says Asha, who shared her experiences at a round table meeting in the capital on Tuesday. District government doctors give lists of HIV positive people to PPTCT volunteers to follow-up. \"The project enables a woman or mothers to go to heath services and say \"I am HIV+, my child is negative and I need medical assistance,\" said Akhila Sivdas, executive director, Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR) that advocates for informed representation about gender and development issues such as HIV/AIDS, child rights and violence against marginalised groups. The PPTCT project was implemented by the Positive Women's Network (PWN+), a Tamil Nadu Voluntary Health Association (TNVHA), Arogya Agam, Tamil Nadu and Society for People's Action for Development (SPAD), Karnataka. According to Padmavati, president (PWN+) Tamil Nadu, the project is making a big difference in tribal districts such as Nilgris, Theni and Coimbatore. \"In those places the volunteers are literally the lynchpins of the programme. Every village has a volunteer network and the women, though they don't get an honorarium, are happy to work as volunteers because they have had positive children themselves and they do not want others to go through the same experience\". Citing a highpoint of the programme, Padmavati described how a volunteer secured 30 ration cards (a necessary document for securing various government healthcare facilities) from the Coimbatore collector for the HIV+ women of the area in a single day. For Gajalaxmi, Sex Workers Collective from Trichi district, the lack of such documents led to sex workers facing discriminations towards their rights and entitlements. \"If other women have to make two-three visits to avail of an entitlement, a sex worker would have to go 10-12 times. Even today 50% of them do not succeed in getting their entitlements,\" she said. Tracing the journey undertaken by the Christian Aid, EU and four other civil society organizations in extending PPTCT services to positive women, Semeda Steve, programme manager, Christian Aid maintained that since the programme began the response from HIV positive women has gone up from 7% to 93% in intervention areas. On the occasion a report, Standing Shoulder to Shoulder: Documentation of Best Practices (stories from Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Karnataka), was released by Syeda Hameed, member, Planning Commission."}

However, the words seem totally meaningless in the world where people discriminate HIV positive people, even in hospitals. The trouble for HIV infected Ram (name changed), about whom TOI reported a week ago, were seemingly endless. There was discrimination in getting medical aid at Shiv Prasad Gupta (SPG) divisional hospital. Now, the fate of another HIV patient Vishal (name changed) who, incidentally, has been admitted in the adjacent bed, is also the same. Both these patients lay neglected in ward number 2 of divisional hospital. The lack of awareness about the disease has made the hospital staff reluctant to attend these patients. When TOI reported about the discrimination against Ram in the hospital, the chief medical officer (CMO), Dr MP Chaurasia and district magistrate, Pranjal Yadav and the hospital authorities assured to give proper treatment to him. However, six days later, Ram is still in the similar situation. So is the case with Vishal. Both patients are suffering from severe gangrene infection in their legs and hands and have the history of intravenous drug addiction. Since both are HIV infected. But the paramedical staff of the hospital has refused to attend them. \"They do not even touch me, forget bandaging the wounds. My mother gets the cotton and bandage from the nurses and apply it on my leg, she is uneducated and knows nothing about medicines. I feel helpless. I want to die,'' said Ram, his eyes welling up. According to Vishal, his dressing has not been done from the past one week. He gets his dressing done from a private clinic situated outside the hospital after paying Rs 50 every day. The two cannot go to any other hospital for their treatment because both of them come from very weak economic background. The case of these HIV positive patients has only raised question over the implementation of NACO guidelines that clearly says that HIV AIDS patients are to be treated at par with the general patients. There should be no discrimination, the guideline say. It also does not support any separate ward for these patients. In fact the counselors of Integrated Counseling and Testing Centre (ICTC) in the hospital have also accepted that the hospital staff is not attending the HIV patients properly. The amount of unawareness prevailing in the hospital can be judged from what the para medical staff say. One of them, Saikhu said \"The medical equipments, scissor, knives required for dressing are same for the ward. We cannot use the same equipment to perform dressing on HIV patients. They have separate arrangement at Sir Sundar Lal (SSL) hospital, Banaras Hindu University (BHU). They can go there\". But the hospital authorities do not accept this. \"Giving separate treatment to HIV patients will lead to discrimination. The patients are treated well and their bandage and dressing is done by the hospital staff only\", said superintendent in chief of the hospital, Dr VK Srivastava."}

We don't have any arrangement for taking care of such a patient, hence we are unable to take care of his wound,\" said para-medic Saikhu. The hospital's attitude towards Ram is indicative of the stigma and lack of awareness among the hospital staff regarding HIV. The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has clear guidelines that HIV AIDS patients are to be treated at par with general patients and without discrimination. It also does not support any separate ward for these patients. The hospital's silence over not offering any assistance in shifting the patient to BHU is also a major issue. Meanwhile, taking serious note of the reports of discrimination against HIV positive patient, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has sought a report from the Shiv Prasad Gupta (SPG) Divisional Hospital on the issue. Through a letter, the NACO has ordered officials concerned to probe into the matter and submit a report within a week. Accepting that such a letter has been received by the hospital administration, superintendent-in-chief (SIC), SPG Hospital, Dr VK Srivastava said, \"The patient is staying in the hospital on his own free will. He is not ready to shift to the BHU. We have already informed the CMO and the police about it. The hospital staff has never discriminated against the patient. We will submit a report to NACO by Friday.\" Meanwhile, the 'Banaras Network for Positive People Living with HIV' a non-profit organisation run by HIV positive people has also taken the matter seriously. According to Manoj Singh, president, BNPPL, they have filed a detailed report on the discrimination and neglect faced by Ram in the divisional hospital. \"By discharging and referring these two HIV patients, hospital only wants to unburden its load. The hospital lacks proper facilities and there is complete lack of coordination. We have filed a detailed report about these two patients and are sending it to Uttar Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (UPSACS),\" said Manoj."}

Police said Isaac Robin, 34, of Kalandhapanai in Panakudi police limits in Tiruneveli district had been working as a supervisor at construction sites. He used to travel to different states as part of his job. His mother Gnanalet and brother Prabu, 30, were living in their native village. His father, Jacon, died a few years ago. Last year, Robin came home as he fell sick and medical examination confirmed that he was suffering from AIDS. He stayed with his mother and brother. However, their relatives started distancing themselves from Robin's family. Over a period of time, visits by outsiders stopped when they came to know of Robin's disease. Disheartened by the social stigma, the mother and brother asked Robin to leave home. But he refused. On August 5, the mother lodged a complaint with the Panakudi police claiming that her son had started vomiting blood and died a few minutes later. Police registered a case under Section 174 of the IPC and the body was sent for postmortem. The body was handed over to the family on August 7 and it was cremated later. However, the postmortem report, which came on Saturday, revealed that the man had been strangled and that his neck bones and windpipe were broken. Upon the directions of Tirunelveli superintendent of police Vijayendra Bidari, police registered a case under Section 302 of the IPC and launched a lookout for Gnanalet, Prabu and his friend Vivek, 29, who were absconding. The mother and brother were arrested on Sunday and they confessed to murdering the man. Police said that Robin had come to the house against his mother's wish and started consuming liquor along with his brother and Vivek. He began to abuse his mother in an inebriated state in front of his brother, who allegedly strangled him. The superintendent of police said it looked as if social stigma had led to the mother and sibling resorting to the extreme step. They were remanded in police custody."}

The facility will now be made available in the remotest primary health centres (PHCs) of state. Earlier, the health authorities were targeting only high risk groups for the test. But now even the common population will be brought in its ambit and free HIV card test will be made available in the remotest PHCs in state. The HIV test, apart from 14 other tests, will be provided free-of-cost at all PHCs from April 15 under the chief minister free diagnostic test scheme phase III. The test is already free at district hospitals and community health centres (CHCs). According to the recently-released HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS), the prevalence of HIV in state increased from 0.19% in 2008-09 to 0.38 in 2011-12. Rajasthan is a low prevalence state but is highly vulnerable due to the presence of high risk groups including female sex workers, injectable drug users, truckers and labourers. Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) project director Dr SS Chauhan said, \"Earlier, National Aids Control Organization (NACO) and RSACS provided free test to high risk groups only. Also, in cooperation with National Rural Health Mission many Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) were started. But, now the government has decided to reach out to the common population. So, the HIV card test will be made available at PHCs also from April 15.\" The RSACS has already provided training to para-medical staff for counseling and tab technicians for conducting tests at CHCs and now there are plans to provide training to the staff at all PHCs. \"But, without a person's consent, no one can conduct HIV test. So, consent is must and compulsory for HIV testing,\" an RSACS official said. Moreover, RSACS has set a target to conduct HIV test on all pregnant women, added the official. It is estimated that 19 lakh infants are born every year in Rajasthan. So, by screening pregnant women, transmission of virus from mother to child can be prevented. \"There is 25-30% risk of transmission of virus from infected mother to the baby, but that risk can be minimized by the screening test and by giving medicines to the infected mother,\" he said."}

DAPCU nodal officer Dr OP Shahi told TOI that National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) has mooted a proposal to spread awareness among workers of these industries on HIV/AIDS across the country and Allahabad was the first district chosen for the pilot project. Unit officials had had a meeting with industry officials earlier this month and asked the authorities concerned to draw a plan for the programme. Once the proposal is submitted, nodal officers will be appointed and training teams formed. \"Once everything is finalized, we would be offering training to medical and paramedical staff and employees of the industries and sensitize them,\" Dr Shahi said. DAPCU officials said that at least 40% people among the target groups of migrant labouers and truckers were not aware of the factors responsible for the spread of AIDS. There are many who do not want to know about it owing to misconceptions or hesitation. Allahabad district is already classified under category 'A' by NACO as far as spread of AIDS is concerned due to its vast strength of migrant labourers and truckers. All prevention and care interventions specified by the organization need to be scaled up on priority. Authorities have recommended implementation of the link workers programme in the Category 'A' and 'B' districts of the country in a phased manner. More attention has been paid to Allahabad district as its boundary connects it with seven others."}

The five-year-long study, conducted by the Pune-based National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) along with HIV Neurobehavioral Research Programme at the University of California, San Diego, found that people with HIV/ AIDS in India are at higher risk of developing milder neuro-cognitive impairment if treatment is not initiated. The study was completed in May this year. The study has indicated a higher baseline prevalence (47%) of neuro-cognitive impairment in people with advanced HIV infection who are yet to take treatment. Neurocognitive impairment affects cognition (thinking), motor control (body movements) and the psychological state of the individual. The world over, people with HIV infection are living longer and having a better quality of life due to greater access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thanks to ART, HIV induced illnesses like cryptococal meningitis have been on the decline. However, conditions like HIV-associated neuro-cognitive disorder (HAND) are still prevalent. The study also assumes significance as earlier studies in the western world were based on the subtype B virus that causes HIV infection. However, in India, clade C is the most common subtype. Based on its characteristics, clade C has been found to affect an individual\u2019s nervous system less severely than other subtypes. It was milder than the subtype B prevalent in Europe and America, researchers say. \u201cThe baseline finding of the study suggests that clinicians and healthcare providers must know if people living with HIV have any difficulties with cognition or performing daily activities. The family members or the caregivers should also be told of such conditions so that they can detect changes in the individual and seek timely advice from healthcare providers,\u201d researcher Manisha Ghate, co-principal investigator of the study, told TOI on Thursday. Ghate said, \u201cThe routine activities of HIV-infected people may get affected if they have neuro-cognitive impairment. In milder forms, it may be prominent only while performing complex tasks like calculations and multitasking. But it is pronounced in severe forms like dementia and patients may have difficulty even in performing routine daily activities like cooking, bathing and walking. Cognitive impairment associated with HIV has been correlated with the increased complaints of job performance difficulties and poor medication adherence.\u201d Researcher Sanjay Mehendale, the principal investigator of the study, said, \u201cThe beneficial effect of ART has been observed in cognitively impaired individuals. The improvement was seen in the domains of learning, executive functioning and motor performance. This beneficial effect was also observed in cognitively impaired individuals with higher CD4 counts.\u201d Even otherwise, healthy people show neurological decline as they age. \u201cBut here we have a younger population infected with HIV, so this effect will be greater as they age. Patients need counselling in addition to ART,\u201d Ghate said. When contacted, NARI director Ramesh Paranjape said, \u201cThis is the first comprehensive study in India which has additionally evaluated viral and host factors associated with neuro-cognitive impairments in people with HIV.\u201d Why the study? People with HIV infection are living longer and better due to improved access to antiretroviral therapy. Though neurological opportunistic infections are on decline, non opportunistic conditions like HIV associated neurocognitive impairment (HAND) remain prevalent. It has been shown that the impaired cognitive performance can affect routine activities, employment, adherence to treatment and quality of life. The studies have been conducted globally, but the data on the prevalence and co-factors associated with HAND available from systematically conducted research in India is scanty. Study details This is the first comprehensive study in India which has additionally evaluated viral and host factors associated with neuro-cognitive impairments in people with HIV.Pune-based National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) along with HIV Neurobehavioral Research Programme at the University of California, San Diego.The study was initiated in September 2008 and completed recently in May 2013. The study was conducted in adult population above 18 years of age.The data was collected in three groups: 1) HIV infected individuals with advanced disease (CD4 count less than 200 cells/cmm) : [number of patients were 125], 2) HIV infected individuals with CD4 count between 350-550 cells/cmm : [number of patients were 128] and 3) HIV uninfected individuals [number of patients were 287]. All participants received a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, neuromedical assessment and laboratory evaluation.The neuropsychological test battery that was used in this study was developed at HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center (HNRC) San Diego and standardized in Indian population prior to useAfter baseline evaluations, all individuals with CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3 received ART treatment as per the national guidelines and nearly 50% HIV individuals with CD4 count between 350 and 550 cells/mm3 were given immediate antiretroviral treatment (they were co enrolled from a ongoing clinical trial). The participants were followed every year for neuropsychological evaluation. The cognitive battery included tests in the domain of fluency, speed of information processing, attention, executive functioning,learning, memory and motor performance. The outcome on ART was evaluated based on the performance in these tests.

But late last month his luck ran out when he was caught along with his partner Raj Kumar on the way to Meerut. Police say the duo was involved in around 50 cases of vehicle theft and robbery. Their arrest came about as the car they had stolen was equipped with a GPS tracking system. On the morning of August 23, a woman from Saket in south Delhi reported the theft of her Santro car. Inspector Rituraj, whom DCP south PS Kushwah had put in charge of a team to catch vehicle thieves, used her mobile phone to locate the car. The car was in Kaushambi, Ghaziabad at the time. Immediately, a police team accompanied by the woman set off to seize it. When they reached Kaushambi, the accused fled towards Meerut.

The woman's attendant, Babloo, on Monday alleged precious time was lost after she was admitted on Thursday. Her condition deteriorated with the passage of every day. Babloo also alleged harassment at the hands of blood bank officials, saying he was made to run in circles to donate replacement blood even though the state government has ordered not to seek replacement blood from HIV+ patients. After the woman's death on Monday, at least two HIV+ patients came forward, alleging apathy at the hands of the PMCH doctors. A 25-year-old from Barh has his bone below the knee fractured. \"It was plastered, but it didn't heal. I was referred to PMCH which, in turn, referred me to ART (antiretroviral therapy) centre,\" he said. Incidentally, ART centres are units which distribute medicines for slowing down the growth of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The Barh patient said he confronted the PMCH superintendent, asking how the ART centre would treat him. The superintendent on July 29 wrote on his prescription, \"The patient is already registered with the ART centre of Rajendra Memorial Research Institute since November 9, 2010. Presently the patient has developed distal tibia. (He) needs orthopaedic treatment and consultation. (He is) referred to ortho OPD for immediate treatment and needful.\" A medical officer of the ART centre also gave a similar observation. \"Still I am running from pillar to post. Every time I am asked to come on Tuesday and every time I am told the doctor concerned has not come,\" he alleged. Another patient of Basauri village of Bhojpur district is registered with the PMCH's ART centre since July 1, 2010. He says he had gone to the medicine department of the hospital for endoscopy, but was asked to go home when it was discovered he was HIV+. \"The nurse asked me to go wherever I wished and no one will take any action,\" he wrote to the PMCH superintendent on July 19, 2013. Almost two months on, his wait for endoscopy continues. BSACS' governing council member Gyan Ranjan said ART centres in the hospitals are not apathetic towards such patients. \"However if an HIV+ person goes to any department for treatment, s/he faces harassment. Most of such patients cannot afford private health facilities,\" he said."}

Heena (name changed to protect identity), who was suffering from urinary tract infection was taken to SSKM Hospital on September 2. After allegedly waiting for about a week for admission, the 24-year-old was finally taken away by the community members on Tuesday. Last heard, she was on her way to a place in Bihar for 'treatment' by quacks. Heena's fault was that she got castrated in February this year somewhere in Bihar by 'professionals' in the community. Heena was also detected to be HIV-positive about a couple of months back. With no encouragement from the community to go to a hospital, Heena was treated by quacks for a few weeks. But when her condition deteriorated, she sought the help of Association of Trangenders and Hijras in Bengal (ATHB). After running from one official to another at SSKM, Heena was asked to come to the hospital on September 9. She was checked by doctors of the urology department on September 9 and advised admission. But the hospital authority said since Heena had undergone castration, she needed an order from a district judge for admission. \"We had no knowledge of this formality. They kept insisting that we get this order from a district judge. How could the patient get it when she herself was unable to move because of the ailment? We were worried about her condition,\" said ATHB secretary Ranjita Sinha. Heena's cries of pain fell on deaf ears as the hospital allegedly kept citing the legal issues. Aggravating the problem was the absence of a separate ward for the third sex. Even as some doctors were sympathetic, they too pleaded helplessness. The hospital also told them that a relative had to sign a risk bond in case admission was granted. Since Heena has no family, her 'hirja gurus' were convinced by ATHB to sign the bond. Accordingly, some from the community came to the hospital. But seeing the delay and the apathy, they took Heena away and she left for Bihar on Wednesday morning. In the meantime, ATHB members sought the intervention of the West Bengal State AIDs Prevention and Control Society (WBSAPCS). While some officials claimed that they were talking to hospital authorities; some pleaded that they were out of station. \"Some people from the eunuch community who had come to the hospital were getting impatient. They were pained by the way Heena was suffering. They lamented that they had no place in the society, even in hospitals. Despite our plea to wait for another day, they took Heena away,\" said Sinha. Heena is probably getting 'treatment' right now from quacks somewhere in Bihar. None from SSKM wanted to comment on the allegation. Dr D N Goswami, joint director (TI), who was constantly informed about the problem, also refused to comment saying that he was busy in a meeting. Other WBSAPCS officials, however, said they would look into the issue. \"I had no knowledge about this. This should not have happened. Despite our effort to create awareness and sensitivity, there is still room for improvement. We will take up the issue once we get a complaint on it,\" said Dr Himadri Shekhar Sanyal, additional project director, WBSAPCS."}

During the health camps, labourers would be apprised about HIV and AIDS and precautions against the deadly disease. As Allahabad district has already been placed under 'A' category regarding HIV transmission, fresh efforts are being made to identify new patients and to provide proper treatment to identified patients.

He further added that it was a NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation) initiative and under the same awareness campaigns and health camps would be held in 30 cities of the state. The UP State AIDS Control Society (UPSACS) has too laid its stress on carrying out an extensive educational and awareness campaign with special attention on migrants. Dr Shahi, meanwhile, said, \"We have been carrying out an extensive awareness campaign through various means including folk art to capture people's attention. Folk art like nukkad natak, nautanki, magic show, puppet show and kabbali are the best source of spreading awareness among people.\" As far as route of infection and transmission categories are concerned, in 85.3% cases, the disease spreads due to unsafe sexual contact, while 3.80%, 2.05%, 3.34% and 6.46% cases are due to prenatal transmission, blood transfusion, injectable drug users, respectively. Officials are also mapping high-risk groups like female sex workers, intravenous drug users and homosexuals, so that concrete measures can be initiated to restrict the spread of the virus.

I have now proposed that such patients be operated every Saturday, so that other operations are not affected. An OT has to be fumigated for 24 hours after operating an HIV patient and it can't be used for that duration. The hospital superintendent will take a final call on this proposal.\" To remove doctors' reservation over operating on such patients, safety kits have already been provided to all the departments.

This will ensure that the blood is not wasted, said Dr Karak. It may be mentioned here that the attendants of a 45-year-old HIV+ woman, who died in PMCH on September 9, had alleged that they could not get blood on time despite being ready to provide replacement blood. The doctors treating the woman had also said that the woman required urgent transfusion of blood.

In a breakthrough, researchers, including an Indian-origin scientist, have created a microbicide that can trick HIV into killing itself without disturbing any healthy cells. Pinning down an effective way to combat the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus, the viral precursor to AIDS, has long been a challenge for scientists and physicians, because the virus is an elusive one that mutates frequently and, as a result, quickly becomes immune to medication. A team of Drexel University researchers is trying to get one step ahead of the virus with a microbicide they've created that can trick HIV into \"popping\" itself into oblivion. The microbicide DAVEI - which stands for \"Dual Action Virolytic Entry Inhibitor\" - is the latest in a new generation of HIV treatments that function by specifically destroying the virus without harming healthy cells, researchers said. \"While several molecules that destroy HIV have recently been announced, DAVEI is unique among them by virtue of its design, specificity and high potency,\" said Dr Cameron Abrams, a professor in Drexel's College of Engineering and a primary investigator of the project. A team co-led by Abrams and Dr Irwin Chaiken in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in Drexel's College of Medicine, and including R V Kalyana Sundaram, developed the chimeric recombinantly engineered protein - that is, a molecule assembled from pieces of other molecules and engineered for a specific purpose, in this case to fight HIV. HIV invades a healthy cell by first attaching via protein \"spikes\" that then collapse to pull viral and cell membranes together, fusing them and allowing the genetic contents of the virus to enter the healthy cell. The cell is rewired by the viral genetic material into producing more viruses instead of performing its normal function, which, in the case of cells infected by HIV, involves normal immunity. AIDS is the result. \"We hypothesised that an important role of the fusion machinery is to open the viral membrane when triggered, and it follows that a trigger didn't necessarily have to be a doomed cell,\" Abrams said. \"So we envisioned particular ways the components of the viral fusion machinery work and designed a molecule that would trigger it prematurely,\" Abrams said. The team designed DAVEI from two main ingredients. One piece, called the Membrane Proximal External Region (MPER), is itself a small piece of the fusion machinery and interacts strongly with viral membranes. The other piece, called cyanovirin, binds to the sugar coating of the protein spike. Working together, the MPER and cyanovirin in DAVEI \"tweak\" the fusion machinery in a way that mimics the forces it feels when attached to a cell. The study was published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy."}

But, thanks to the exclusive legal aid centre at ART centre in Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH). The centre has so far dealt with 137 cases related to injustice done to patients infected with HIV, who are mostly women. Since its inauguration in April 2010, the legal aid centre has so far handled 153 cases including 78 male and 75 female cases related to various types of discrimination against people infected with HIV. Around 137 cases have been solved outside the court. For instance, a 33-year-old man from Palakkarai in Trichy, who was tested HIV positive after his marriage to a 24-year-old woman in Pudukkottai, died in January 2012. Since her husband succumbed to HIV, the family of her husband harassed her in order to chase her away from them. Moreover, they denied her a share in their property. The woman was brought to the legal aid centre a few months after her husband's death. The advocate and the counsellor counselled the family members of her husband and explained them about the legal consequences they would face if she was denied of her rights. Only then his family agreed to give her share. Initially they disagreed to give her the share as they were under the impression that their son was infected with HIV because of his wife. But the fact was that she was infected with HIV by her husband. \"We are successfully dealing with the case and trying to get justice. The HIV affected people can approach the legal aid centre for solving their problems. The legal aid centre functions on Tuesday and Friday,\" said advocate KAV Dinakaran, who has been dealing with such cases for the past two years. In some cases, the family of the husband is withholding the dowry given to the woman. Likewise, many people don't return the money borrowed from the HIV affected person after the death. Such cases have also been dealt. \"The families of the husband try to seize the property that should be given to his wife. I have come across some patients who were even denied to use the ration card by the family of her husband. The women, who are already upset after being infected by her husband, can not think of approaching the court.

It will also be checked that these people are taking regular medicines through ART centres. At the same time, people who have left the treatment will also be connected by carrying out extensive search and will be put on the treatment once again by giving appropriate counselling to them, he informed.

The topical anti-fungal drug Ciclopirox causes HIV infected cells to commit suicide by jamming up the cells\u2019 powerhouse \u2014 the mitochondria, researchers said. Unlike current anti-HIV drugs, Ciclopirox completely eradicates infectious HIV from cell cultures, with no rebound of virus when the drug is stopped, according to researchers at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. The treatment of patients with HIV has been revolutionized by the advent of combination anti-retroviral drugs. However, although these drugs are highly effective at keeping HIV at bay, they must be taken for the life of the patient and never eliminate the infection completely . This is illustrated by the often rapid resurgence of virus in patients who stop taking these medications. The persistence of HIV is partially due to the ability of the virus to disable the cell's altruistic suicide pathway, which is normally activated when a cell becomes infected or damaged. A team of researchers led by Michael Mathews and Hartmut Hanauske-Abel, previously showed that Ciclopirox, commonly used by dermatologists and gynaecologists to treat fungal infections, inhibits the expression of HIV genes in culture. The drug works inhibits the expression of HIV genes and also blocks the essential function of the mitochondria, thereby reactivating the cell\u2019s suicide pathway. Healthy, uninfected cells examined during this study were spared. And remarkably, the virus did not bounce back when Ciclopirox was removed, researchers said. The utility of Ciclopirox in patients with HIV, for instance after topical application to reduce sexual transmission of the virus, awaits verification in future clinical trials."}

Doctors found that the girl had HIV when she was admitted to a private hospital for treatment of cold and pneumonia few months ago. It was not clear how she contracted the disease as her parents tested negative for the infection. What baffled the doctors more was that the donor, whose blood was picked from a local private blood bank and transfused to the girl, also tested negative. Suspecting that the doctors of the private hospital tampered with the records, the parents lodged a complaint with the local police against the doctors and the blood bank organisers. With private doctors hitting streets against the police case and harassment, district collector Suresh Kumar ordered a thorough probe into the incident. A medical team headed by the head of pediatric wing at GGH, district medical health officer (DMHO) and two other experts conducted an in-depth investigation into the incident by sending the blood samples of the baby and her parents to a private lab in Chennai for PCR test.

The ring is easy to use, long-lasting, and recently has demonstrated a 100 per cent success rate protecting primates from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). The device will soon undergo its first test in humans, researchers said. \"After 10 years of work, we have created an intra-vaginal ring that can prevent against multiple HIV exposures over an extended period of time, with consistent prevention levels throughout the menstrual cycle,\" said Patrick Kiser, an expert in intra-vaginal drug delivery. Previous studies have demonstrated that antiviral drugs can prevent HIV infection, but existing methods for delivering the drug fall short. Pills must be taken daily and require high doses; vaginal gels that must be applied prior to each sex act are inconvenient, yielding poor usage rates. The new ring is easily inserted and stays in place for 30 days. Moreover, because it is delivered at the site of transmission, the ring \u2014 known as a TDF-IVR (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate intravaginal ring) \u2014 utilizes a smaller dose than pills. The device contains powdered tenofovir, an anti-retroviral drug that is taken orally by 3.5 million HIV-infected people worldwide, but that has not previously been studied topically, researchers said. The ring's strength stems from its unique polymer construction: its elastomer swells in the presence of fluid, delivering up to 1,000 times more of the drug than current intra-vaginal ring technology, such as NuvaRing, which are made of silicon and have release rates that decline over time. The upcoming clinical trial, to be conducted in November at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, will evaluate the ring in 60 women over 14 days. The trial will assess the ring's safety and measure how much of the drug is released and the properties of the ring after use. Other drugs could potentially be integrated into the ring, such as contraceptives or antiviral drugs to prevent other sexually transmitted infections \u2014 a feature that could increase user rates, said Kiser, who joined Northwestern University from the University of Utah, where the research was conducted. The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)."}

But, these inmates are left in the lurch due to lack of treatment. There are about 1,700 inmates in the central prison. In the last six months alone, 12 new HIV positive inmates have been identified. Sources from the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS) allege that lack of cooperation and interest among the higher officials of the society and central prison has been hindering treatment for the inmates. Treatment for the newly-detected cases in the last six months could not be started due to this. \"As many as six inmates were found with HIV infection in April this year alone after undergoing the mandatory tests for new inmates of the prison. In May, no case was detected. However, six cases were detected between June and September. Since homosexual activity is rampant in the prison the inmates have high risk of getting infection. Detecting the HIV patients and providing required treatment for them is indispensable,\" said sources from the TANSACS. Doctors say that testing the HIV patients at regular intervals is absolutely necessary. They should be brought to the anti-retroviral treatment (ART) on the premises of the Government Rajaji Hospital for treatment. They would be provided with medicines and kept in observation to analyse the patients' reaction to the medicine. Sources from TANSACS said that they could not provide treatment for the HIV inmates since they are not brought to ART centres by the prison authorities. Citing inadequate police strength to escort the inmates to the centre, the officers refuse to send them for treatment. As a consequence, the inmates are deprived of proper treatment ending up in getting only regular tablets, they said. Moreover, TANSACS officials could not follow the HIV positive inmates when they are released on bail since majority of the prisoners' address available with the prison are found to be fake, the sources added. When contacted, M Kalirajan, district programme manager for prevention and control of HIV-AIDS, Madurai said, \"We are aware of the situation. We have taken up the issue to the notice of our project director a month ago. Action is yet to be taken. We have also suggested an alternative idea of sending ART specialists inside the prison to treat the patients.\" K Anandan, superintendent of police, Madurai Central Prison when contacted said that they rely only on the city police to escort the HIV positive inmates to GRH. At times when the city police's strength is fully utilised for heavy security the inmates cannot be taken to the hospital. In such cases they would send paramedical staff to collect tables from the hospital, he said."}

The rate of positivity oscillated between 10-13% from 1996 to 2001 but came down to 1.7% in 2012. The decrease in HIV cases has been significant since 2008, in which year the rate of positivity dropped to 6.10% and in the subsequent year it dropped to 4.25%. As per the last count, in April 2013, 168 new cases were detected as against 1,000-900 new cases registered every year about a decade ago. Dr Sachin Govenkar, project director, Goa State Aids Control society (GSACs), said better surveillance, awareness programmes and interventions, have helped curb HIV in the state. The drop in number of HIV cases is significant because the number of blood samples tested during the last five years is far higher than between 2003 and 2008. Since 2009 onwards, the number of blood samples tested crossed the 30,000-mark, whereas during the preceding years' blood samples tested varied between 14,000 and 25,000 a year. In 2012 itself, 44,553 blood samples were tested and 532 new cases were detected during that period. \"Intensified awareness programmes carried out by the GSACs for over a decade in co-ordination with NGOs have proved effective in curtailing the number of cases,\" a GSACs official said. There have been no other changes observed in the detection pattern of HIV infections. Four major coastal talukas -- Tiswadi, Bardez, Salcete and Mormugao continue to have a high rate of HIV prevalence. Also, 80-85% of the total HIV cases belong in the age group of 15-49 years, and sexual transmission is the predominant mode of contraction. Antiretroviral therapy started in Goa Medical College (GMC) & Hospital, Bambolim, in 2005 has been a great solace to HIV/AIDS patients.

The 7-year-old boy from Barasat was only a toddler when he lost his father to HIV/AIDS. His mother, also HIV-positive, begs for a living. HIV-affected Rahul was over the moon on Tuesday when he got new clothes for this year, thanks to nursing students and staff of the College of Nursing, RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. \"Ami packet ta khule dekhbo ki dress acchhe? (May I open the packet to see what dress is in it?)\", asked Ria Mistry. The five-year-old lost her father to AIDS before she was born. Her mother succumbed to the disease two months ago. Since then, she has been living with her ailing grandparents in Basirhat. The students and staff of the nursing college distributed clothes to around 60 HIV-positive children. Most of these kids got the disease from their parents. A few of the thalassaemic children got infected during blood transfusion. \"Durga Puja is the time when people especially children love to flaunt their new clothes. Most of these children are orphans. Our students and staff have collected money to bring a smile on their faces. Such an interaction also helps us change the attitude of people towards HIV-positive patients,\" said S Das, a senior lecturer at the college. This is the second successive year the college has gifted clothes and other gifts to HIV-positive children under the 'Joy of Giving' campaign. For the students it was not just the joy of giving but an opportunity to interact with HIV patients. \"Even in the medical fraternity, awareness on HIV/AIDS is very low. An interaction with these patients helps remove the mental block. Spending time with them is an opportunity to learn and understand them better,\" said Apabrita Bandyopadhyay, a fourth-year nursing student. The college has tied up with North 24-Parganas Network for People living with HIV/AIDS (NNP+). West Bengal State AIDS Prevention and Control Society project director Utpal Bhattacharya, who was present at the function, lauded the students and teachers of the college for their gesture that touched the hearts of several kids.

From April 2008 to March 2009, 2,345 people were found to be HIV positive of 13,387 subjected to blood test to check HIV prevalence. The figure was alarming which put the health department in a tight spot and compelled it to take measures to control the spread of the disease in the district, which is known as the educational and cultural hub of North Karnataka, sources said.

They say that every month around 10 to 15 HIV positive patients tested at the VCTC could not be traced from a total of around 45 positive cases. Although the time needed for the preliminary test is only a couple of minutes, it takes one day's time to announce the results due to the absence of a CMO, who is the authority to approve the test result. Sources from Tansacs say that an estimated 120 HIV positive cases go untraced every year due to this delay. They do not return the next day to receive the results mainly due to fear. If the results are furnished instantly they can be counselled and treated, they add since the anti-retroviral therapy centre to treat the patients is available inside the same building. \"While there are already 4,550 HIV positive patients in Madurai district under treatment, the Tansacs officials are concerned about the growing number of untraced HIV patients in the district.

The insurance regulator has issued draft guidelines seeking views and comments from insurers on issuing life cover policies to persons with HIV/AIDS. The draft circular by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) on policies for people with HIV/AIDS, issued this month, may come into effect from April 2014. Insurers are expected to put in place a board-approved underwriting manual, claims manual, proposal form and other necessary systems before this date. A vast majority of those afflicted in India are in the age bracket of 15 to 49 years. As per estimates, about 2.4 million Indians are living with HIV/AIDS. Children less than 15 years account for 3.5% of it while 83% are in the age group of 15-49 years. Health cover for people suffering from HIV/AIDS already exists. With advances in medical treatment, insurers are able to put in place cost structures. Some standalone health insurance providers like Star Health & Allied Insurance offer such insurance. \"We offer group covers to NGOs for their members. Our policy prescribes the entry parameters,\" V Jagannathan, chairman, Star Health said. Insurers say claims management and profitability will be key concerns when life insurance is offered to those with AIDS. There would be additional costs. \"In terms of product pricing, insurers mostly rely on past claims experience. Since this would be a new product altogether, the pricing could be at both ends of the spectrum. Insurers may start at the lower range, get claims and then revise premiums upwards. They may also err on the side of caution with higher rates in the beginning and as more players come into the market, the rates would become more competitive,\" Rahul Aggarwal, CEO of Optima Insurance Brokers, said. \"The premium loadings would also depend on the age of the person and stage of the condition,\" Vikas Gujral, executive vice-president and head, customer service and operations, Max Life Insurance said. Some companies are looking at dual cover\u2014health in addition to life\u2014to ensure better claim control. \"We may insist on a health cover before issuing a life cover for this segment because in case of AIDS/HIV, the patient has lower immunity than the rest of the population. So, he/she is susceptible to other illnesses as well,\" a life insurer said. Industry observers say that due to the nature of the condition, insurers would also have to contend with a huge claims outgo. \"Chances are high that the insured may use up the sum insured every year and once a policy is issued, it cannot be withdrawn,\" Aggarwal said. Insurers are also playing it safe. Companies like Max and HDFC have already started talks with global reinsurers to participate in this scheme. \"This is a fairly complex product and we are taking inputs from reinsurers as they have global exposure on this front,\" Sanjay Tiwari, vice-president, products, HDFC Life said. \"We would have to keep tabs on patient check-ups, keep abreast of the latest medicines as all of that would go into our claims experience data,\" Gujral said."}

Yet, in the last tourist season Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS) targeted 600 men having sex with men (MSM) and just 200 female sex workers (FSW). According to GACS officials, Goa's profile as a hot-spot international tourist destination has been attracting a number of male and female sex workers who expressly come to Goa during the tourist season and even take on stray jobs during the day. While the exact number of sex workers visiting Goa during the season is not available, GSACS figures of 600 MSM as against 200 FSW raises eyebrows. GSACS officials claim they are not able to tap more FSWs because of the difficulties involved in identifying them. \"Their profiles are varied. Some operate as high-end calls girls, some work in beauty parlours and spas and it is not simple to uncover their real identity to reach out to them,\" a GSACS official said. Identifying MSM is relatively easy, says the GSACS official, as they can be recognized from their style of dressing and walking. Nonetheless, going after them is a tough job, he claimed. GSACS officials prefer to keep their activities on a low key so as to not expose their peer educators to harassment by police. He said the society's peer educators are able to reach out to lower strata of FSW who come to Goa during the season time. \"The peer educators have to work beyond regular working hours, especially at night, battling police who don't take a sympathetic view of their work. The peer educators provide contraceptives and literature in the form of booklets to create awareness among sex workers about safe sex and HIV/AIDS,\" he claimed. Materials are often placed at public toilets, beach shacks, pubs and spas accessible to targeted groups."}

The couple had consumed pesticide on October 24 to get rid of social humiliation. The couple was diagnosed with HIV around three years ago during a blood test when the woman was five-month pregnant. Following doctors' advice, the woman had terminated her pregnancy immediately. The couple was allegedly ostracized by their family members, relatives and neighbours over the last three years. \"I was infected from my husband after we got married in 2008, but I had accepted it as my fate and decided to live together. We didn't have any problem in our marital life, except family members, relatives disgracing us every now and then,\" she told the media in the hospital. The humiliation crossed all limits when their relatives started abusing them in public. The situation turned worse on October 23 when her in-laws decided to throw them out of the village apprehending further spread of the disease if they continued to stay in the locality. \"We decided to take the extreme step and die together to save ourselves from further social and family isolation. Ever since the diagnosis, there have been a lot of medical complications, but our mental agony was far worse. Instead of any moral support, our families rejected us. It was very difficult for us to carry on,\" she said. Her husband had admitted that he was the carrier, she said. With the intervention of the Tripura AIDS Control Society, the couple had joined a network of HIV positive people in the state. Despite humiliation from family members and neighbours, the couple lived a normal life following counseling sessions and assistance from the society. In fact, the man was very popular among a group of 1,600 HIV- positive people. The members had even decided that he would be made the next secretary of the group, an official of the society said. \"We have asked police to take steps against the family members because what they have done is a serious crime.

Around 30 HIV infected children along with their parents and a group of transgender people from the district celebrated their Diwali together at a function organized in the city on Thursday.

The new findings of the AIDS-causing virus's complex envelope, includes sites that future vaccines will try to mimic to elicit a protective immune response. Scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) and Weill Cornell Medical College determined the first atomic-level structure of the tripartite HIV envelope protein?long considered one of the most difficult targets in structural biology and of great value for medical science. \"Most of the prior structural studies of this envelope complex focused on individual subunits; but we've needed the structure of the full complex to properly define the sites of vulnerability that could be targeted, for example with a vaccine,\" said Ian A Wilson, a senior author of the study. HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus, currently infects about 34 million people globally, 10 per cent of whom are children, according to World Health Organisation estimates. Although antiviral drugs are now used to manage many HIV infections, especially in developed countries, scientists have long sought a vaccine that can prevent new infections and perhaps ultimately eradicate the virus from the human population. However, none of the HIV vaccines tested so far has come close to providing adequate protection. This failure is due largely to the challenges posed by HIV's envelope protein, known to virologists as Env. Env's structure is so complex and delicate that scientists have had great difficulty obtaining the protein in a form that is suitable for the atomic-resolution imaging necessary to understand it. \"It tends to fall apart, for example, even when it?s on the surface of the virus, so to study it we have to engineer it to be more stable,\" said biologist Andrew Ward. The research team was able to engineer a version of the Env trimer (three-component structure) that has the stability and other properties needed for atomic-resolution imaging, yet retains virtually all the structures found on native Env. Using cutting-edge imaging methods, electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, the team was able to look at the new Env trimer. The X-ray crystallography study was the first ever of an Env trimer, and both methods resolved the trimer structure to a finer level of detail than has been reported before. The data illuminated the complex process by which the Env trimer assembles and later undergoes radical shape changes during infection and clarified how it compares to envelope proteins on other dangerous viruses, such as flu and Ebola. The findings are published in the journal Science Express."}

There\u2019s her glamorous Basic Instinct avatar that catapulted her to fame, and there\u2019s her philanthropic side \u2013 the one that has her campaigning for Tibetan rights, fighting against AIDS as amfAR\u2019s Global Fundraising Chair and, more recently, saw her honoured with a Peace Summit award in Warsaw. It\u2019s the latter side that Stone divulges in an interview ahead of her first visit to India, where she\u2019ll take part in the country\u2019s first amfAR gala that will be co-chaired by Aishwarya and Abhishek Bachchan, and see a performance by Ke$ha. \u201cIndia has an enormous amount of AIDS awareness,\u201d she says, when asked for the reason behind introducing the gala to India, adding, \u201cSome countries that I go to are still trying to deny that it\u2019s happening. In India, 2.1 million people are living with HIV AIDS. India manufactures most of the drugs that are used to cure HIV around the world, which is an amazing, amazing fact that most people don\u2019t know. Fifty percent of the people who need treatment in India still don\u2019t have access to these drugs. We need to try to remedy this because we are in a situation that just education and awareness can help remedy. Because you\u2019re a country that\u2019s manufacturing the life-saving drugs.\u201d But India\u2019s still among the countries that don\u2019t like to discuss sex openly, and that might be an impediment to spreading AIDS awareness? Stone says, \u201cWe can\u2019t be born unless people have sex. So, whether it\u2019s a taboo word or not, it is the reality of what is occurring everyday, and it\u2019s a loving reality, it is a family reality. In fact, it\u2019s archaic not to say (the word). You can\u2019t not say penicillin if there\u2019s a flu outbreak. It\u2019s illogical, it\u2019s unhelpful, and it\u2019s out of reality. So, whether you want to call it sex or reality or family, you respectfully \u2013 in your culture \u2013 can call it what you want, but that\u2019s what is happening. And there were, in fact, 1,32,000 infections last year, and we know that congratulations to you and your country, for having such spectacular accounting. But to be mature, to be scientific, to be loving, we need to be thoughtful about treating people and we must be thoughtful about what we\u2019re treating. You can\u2019t treat breast cancer if you can\u2019t say breast and if women can\u2019t get their breasts examined. We must have safe places where people can discuss and be treated. Forty-four million people are already dead from AIDS. What logic is there in not discussing the word?\u201d About the gala, that\u2019s an annual fixture in Cannes and Milan, where Hollywood\u2019s who\u2019s who make for pretty photo-ops in their finest evening wear, Stone says, \u201cWhat we do, and what we\u2019re planning to do in India, is to come to your country specifically, to partner with all the HIV work you\u2019ve been doing. The proceeds from amfAR go directly to scientific research. So, what we are looking for is a cure and a vaccine. When we do these benefits we have some parties around it, where we all get to know each other, and in the evening, we come to a common agreement that what we are going to do is have a great time doing a great thing. People generously bid on the auction items (this year\u2019s lineup includes a trip to the Maldives, an Andy Warhol painting, Herb Ritts\u2019 photograph of Madonna), knowing that the money that they give will go to scientific research and grants.\u201d"}

Over the past couple of years, drying up of funding from the international agency has resulted in shutting down of several facilities. For the past few days, antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres across the country have been suffering from a shortage of medicines. An increasing number of patients being served by the ART centres is only making matters worse. Doctors in the centres from the city have been redirecting the patients to buy medicines that otherwise would have been provided free of cost to them. The city has three such centres, while a fourth one is being planned to overcome the patients' difficulties. Replying to a complaint about shortage of medicines at the centres, national programme officer of National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) Dr BB Rewari wrote, \"We did have some shortage of drugs due to late supplies, but all drugs have now been received at all State AIDS Control Societies. In case there is still a shortage at any sites due to distribution issues, as our partner, PLHA network is requested to inform concerned SACS immediately.\" Similar shortages are being seen in other ART centres across the country, too. Sources said that the entire supply chain has been affected by the global fund scam. \"World Health Organisation (WHO) had also prescribed a drug different from the one being given at the ART centers around the same time. The stocks of these new medicines were less than the required amount whereas the stocks of the older medicines are still being used whenever there is a deficit of the new one,\" said a source. However, some of the patients did not want the older medicines and so had to be asked to buy the new ones off the market. One ART centre should ideally be providing services to less than 2,000 patients, informed Tanuja Fale, programme officer of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU). \"In 2005, there was only one ART centre in the city, now there are three, one each at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Mayo Hospital and Kamthi that as started earlier this year. The centres at both the hospitals get more than 2,500 patients every day,\" she said. To counter this difficulty, DAPCU is trying to open one more ART centre in the city, she said. There are many complaints that patients have with the existing centres, though. \"The centre at GMCH is on the first floor and so a bit difficult to access for patients. There is no proper seating arrangement there too,\" said Sunil Mhaiskar of NGO Sanjeevan Bahudeshi Samaj Seva Sanstha. His organization has approached the Supreme Court for shifting the centre and the issue will be raised in the upcoming Winter Assembly, too. Another activist, Anand Chandrani of Saarthi Trust said that because of the overload, the counselors at the centres are not being able to do much. \"According to NACO guidelines, every patient needs to have a 40-minute session with the counselor. With only a couple of counselors looking after more than 200 patients a day, not much time can be given to every individual,\" he said. The centres are even short of sufficient staff to handle the rush of patients, he added. THE CURRENT PROBLEM: For the past two months, HIV patients are only given maximum five days supply of medicine Short supply of medicine at ART centres forces them to buy drugs off the market RECURRENT PROBLEMS: At GMCH, the ART centre being on the first floor causes accessibility problem to many patients. The centre there is also congested and has no proper seating arrangement Medicine out of stock several times, especially those meant for children are perpetually unavailable The only CD4 machine in the city was defunct for some time earlier and it took months to get operational No viral load machine in any ART centre in city Overload of patients does not give enough time for proper counseling PATIENTS PROBLEMS: Machines do not work most of the times Second line treatment is available at GMCH, still most patients requiring it need to go to Mumbai or Pune Counselors, sometimes, ask personal questions and say moral depreciating things SOLUTION: Opening more ART centers in the city Another CD4 machine and viral load for the city being planned"}

But it\u2019s time to find out today with the help of our nutritionist Neelanjana Singh with Heinz Nutri Life Clinic, we separate the facts and find out if colour diet can actually help in weight loss. Neelanjana explains what colour diet is, its importance and how relevant a role it plays in weight loss. Neelnajana explains the phenomenon of a colour diet, \u201cIt has been increasingly recognised that lots of plant foods colours have main beneficial properties and these are called functional foods. Besides the nutritive value, these colours have pigments in them that work in many ways. Many of them have anti aging properties, anti-oxidants and help complete many beneficial reactions in the body. Colour diet also gives you wonderful hair, skin and helps in digestion.\u201d She details out how a colour diet improves your body, \u201cThese colours are pigments and these pigments are only from plant foods. These are called hypochemicals, which are beneficial chemicals which are found only in plant foods. They have many properties right from anti aging to weight loss. That\u2019s why one says, have as many natural colours in the diet- rainbow diet is one of them that includes many colours in the diet.\u201d Next time you plan a trip to the market, select fruits and vegetables of different colours; make your food vibrant. In terms of weight loss, colour diet has a role to play, Neelanjana tells you how, \u201cWith weight loss what needs to be understood is that anything that is healthy in the long run will help you achieve healthy weight. If you have a colourful diet and have excess calories, it won\u2019t help you to lose weight.

BSACS project director Sanjeev Sinha said the society is not getting the requisite amount of drugs from Naco and national programme officer (ART) in Naco, New Delhi, Dr B B Rewari, said the requisite drugs have already been sent to all states. He said, while talking to TOI over the phone, \"This was a problem some time ago. But all required drugs have been dispatched to all the states last week itself. It is now for the respective state bodies to ensure proper distribution of drugs.\" Patients at 13 ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centres in the state say either they have been returned empty-handed from the centres or made to do rounds of these centres. Subhash Prasad (48) of Lakhisarai, who is registered with Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) ART centre, was told there was no medicine when he went there last time. When he went there for the second time on Wednesday, he was given medicines just for two days. \"Doctors say medicines should not be discontinued. But it is not economically viable for me to come to PMCH every fifth day,\" he rued. Similarly, 50-year-old Mohammad Rameez of Katihar said he got medicines only for two days this week. Kamla Devi, who hails from a village under Bhagwanganj police station, was in tears narrating her tale. \"My 13-year-old son returned empty-handed last time when we visited the PMCH centre. On Wednesday too, I reached there in the morning but they asked me to wait. I am a widow and have no source of income,\" she said. Ironically, the social stigma attached with the disease has not yet wiped off despite a number of awareness campaign carried out by governments and social organizations. Patients are harassed by Doyen, the private pathology service provider at PMCH. \"They straightaway refused to take my blood sample. When I insisted, they asked me to buy a special pair of gloves for the person who will collect my blood sample,\" said Manu Sah, a telecom firm employee at Patna. The story of those registered with Rajendra Memorial Research Institute is no different. Meena Rani (ART no 6027), who went there on Friday, said, \"I was not given any medicine because it wasn't there.\" Doctors say first and second line of treatment at private shops costs Rs 1,500 and Rs 4,000 per month respectively. President of Bihar Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS Society, Gyan Ranjan, said over 100 patients from Mothihari, Muzaffarpur and Chhapra ART centres returned without drugs from the respective centres this week. \"I have written numerous mails to BSACS, but to no avail.\" BSACS governing council member and physician Dr Diwakar Tejaswi said ART drug suppresses HIV virus and restores immunity system of the body which is destroyed by the virus. If there is a gap in medication, the virus becomes resistant and the treatment fails. He further said, \"If first line of medication fails, second line of treatment is prescribed. If that too fails, then it is a death sentence because third line of treatment is not available. The immune system of the body stops functioning.\" (Names of all patients have been changed)"}

The attacker hit Jyothi, threw her down, and left her lying inside the kiosk at one of the city's busiest locations, Corporation Circle, in broad daylight. It was a brazen attack, facilitated by the lack of security. The nature and time of the attack raises the question as to why the kiosk was left unguarded. The Corporation Bank management said the bank has not employed a guard at this ATM centre, though they have one for the bank, about 5 metres away. While police believe it is inexplicable that even big banks fail to follow simple security measures, they are quick to point out that the Reserve Bank of India guidelines do not prescribe a mandatory security guard. A senior RBI official told TOI from Mumbai: \"Banks have some responsibility. They operate independently and not everything needs to be written and sent to them.\" The official also pointed out that the apex bank has, in fact, given specific guidelines to employ security guards at ATM centres located in remote areas and those in the proximity of educational institutions. \"We have also issued guidelines directing banks to relocate or completely remove ATM kiosks from remotely-populated areas as they are vulnerable to crime,\" she said, adding there are guidelines which mandate that banks have an arrangement with local police in sensitive places or where thefts are common. Police sources believe there's a clear lack of intent on the part of banks in keep ATMs secured, despite repeated attempts of theft and attacks. \"We cannot be omnipresent. Every premises is as much the responsibility of the people who run it,\" an officer said.

With the shortage of delivery kits, which doctors wear while assisting in the delivery of HIV positive women, doctors and officials of Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS) were in a fix. Thanks to the two stories published in The Times of India recently, pertaining to the shortage of delivery kits, a consignment of 420 kits, which officials estimate would see them through the next year, reached Madurai a week ago. A regular doctor has been posted in Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART), inside the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) premises, to announce HIV test results immediately, reacting to another story published in the paper in October. Sources from TANSACS said that they have received a consignment of 420 kits. \"During each delivery case of an HIV infected pregnant woman, five kits are needed for a team of doctors. On an average, 80 such cases are handled in Madurai district, majority of them in GRH. With the absence of kits for more than six months, TANSACS officials in Madurai had been managing by borrowing kits from other districts. There was an unnecessary delay in announcing the HIV test results conducted for suspected patients in GRH. The delay was due to the absence of dedicated doctors in the ART centre. Due to the delay, many HIV positive patients who were indifferent to the results could not be traced. Taking note of the news article published in TOI, a doctor has been assigned to the centre with mandatory attendance registry. When contacted, M Kalirajan, District Programme Manager for Prevention and Control of HIV-AIDS, confirmed that they have received the consignment of kits."}

Ahead of World AIDS Day that falls on December 1, students of Panjab University's University Institute of Chemical Engineering and Technology (UICET) have undertaken an initiative to help the neglected sections of society - beginning with a group of HIV positive women. The project, initiated by students of ENACTUS club at UICET, involves supporting a group of 10 women, who are HIV positive. Under the project, 13 members of the club have taken ahead National Aids Control Organization (NACO)-funded group to promote and sell their final products. The self-help unit, which had received a bank loan of Rs 10 lakh through NACO, was unable to find any buyers for the bags they were making, after an initial phase of sales. \"Although the loan helped the women import sewing and printing machines from Germany and produce semi-cloth bags of high quality, they had not been able to bag any orders for over four months. Even as the bags are competitive enough to hold a stand in the market, the women hardly have any market knowledge. This worked to their disadvantage and they couldn't generate any sales,\" said UICET student Aman Arora. He believed that the bio-degradability of the bags will add to their USP, given that plastic bags have been banned in the market. \"These bags decompose in six months and are quite affordable, costing between Rs 160 and Rs 300 per kilogram,\" Arora added. After the students stepped in, the scenario of the unit has changed for the better. On the verge of being shut down in the absence of any orders, the UICET students helped the unit increase its market, outreach as well as profits. The team members went to shops in malls and other markets of Chandigarh for negotiating orders for the bags. \"There was some problem with the screen they used for printing the bags. After it was changed and samples were shown to stores, the response was good. We helped them get orders from shops in leading malls and different markets of the city,\" said UICET's Enactus president Saurabh Mittal. The group organized drives in sectors 8, 9 17, 22 and Mohali's Phase 7 and helped the unit get orders of nearly 250 kg, of which 200kg have already been delivered. Students of the club - Vinay Jain, Navleen Kaur and Tarun Sanduja - also helped create newer designs for prints. Enactus members also intend to include four more HIV positive women and hire a permanent sales executive for the self-help group. The group is guided by their faculty advisor - UICET associate professor Seema Kapoor."}

In a gap of just two years, the rate of new HIV infection has reduced by nearly 30-35 % in some of the centres of the state. Statistics of Uttar Pradesh State AIDS Control Society show that in 2012 and till January 2013, about 656 new cases of HIV were registered for anti-retroviral therapy at the King George's Medical University while the figure stood at 1,444 in 2010. Likewise, 1,818 new persons were put on anti-retroviral therapy in 2012 and till January 2013 at IMS Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi. Not in keeping with this falling trend, however, 3,162 new cases were reported in 2010 for ART at IMS BHU. But, other government centres of the state witnessed a significant fall in new cases of HIV infection. Not only UP, the similar trend has also been witnessed in the country. The recently released UNAIDS Report 2013 stated that India has managed to reduce new HIV infections by 57% between 2001 and 2012. Health experts attributed increased public awareness as one of the main reasons behind the fall in number of new HIV cases being reported. \"Due to various educational programmes, people have become more aware about HIV/AIDS. More and more patients in both government and private hospitals insist on use of new needle for injection,\" said A K Tripathi, head of department of clinical haematology. The other reason is improvement in blood bank services as blood is now checked thoroughly before transfusion. \"The ban on sale of blood has helped a lot,\" said Dr Tripathi. Another major cause is the widespread availability of ART which suppressed the HIV virus and stops the progression of HIV disease. Earlier, ART was available at only a few hospitals of the state but now UP has 22 centres and many district hospitals are linked to centres where HIV persons can get the medicines. \"Due to ART, the situation has now become better than earlier. There has been decline in rate of new HIV infections and it will reduce more in the coming days,\" said Preetam Kaur, president of Lucknow Positive Women Welfare Society. Kaur added, \"We have come even closer to ensuring that children born to mothers with HIV are delivered without contracting the disease. If a pregnant woman with HIV is getting treatment and delivery at a government hospital, children born to them are negative.\""}

The latest report of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) has reported 116 cases of the infection across 30 jails in the state between January and October this year, as against 330 cases that were reported in 2011. This year, the highest number of cases was reported from Thane Central Jail, followed by Adharwadi Jail in Kalyan. Fifteen cases were detected in Yerawada Central Jail, the third-highest number of cases. In all, 17 jails reported HIV cases. \"Of the 15,228 jail inmates who volunteered to get themselves tested for HIV this year, 116 tested positive. Forty five have been put on antiretroviral treatment because of low CD4 count,\" an MSACS official said. The CD4 cells are specialised cells that protect the body. The virus attacks these cells and uses them to spread, which weakens the immune system. Officials of MSACS said that jail inmates are regularly informed about the causes of spread of HIV and counselled to reduce risks. \"We have trained counsellors who help spread awareness about HIV infection among prisoners and encourage them to get themselves tested. This has resulted in reducing the number of cases over the years,\" said an official of MSACS. Prisoners contract diseases that are determined both by the environment they come from and also the prison they live in, say experts. If adequate treatment is not given to inmates in jails, they will return to the community further burdening the existing healthcare facilities of the country, say experts. \"The jail inmates are among the most vulnerable population to contract HIV infection due to homosexual relations and through contaminated needles which are used for injecting recreational drugs,\" said senior scientist Ramesh Paranjape, director of National AIDS Research Institute (NARI). Experts note that the prison environment, lack of occupation of mind and body and plain boredom lead to accumulated frustration and tension. This environment leads to high-risk activities, such as use of drugs and unprotected sex between men. \"When people living with HIV are released from incarceration and return to their sexual and/or needle-sharing partners in the community, their partners face increased risk of HIV infection while they may not be aware that they are at risk,\" said A L Kakrani, professor and head, department of medicine, D Y Patil Medical College. A recent UNAIDS report said the HIV epidemic in Asia was concentrated largely among people who inject drugs, sex workers and their clients, and MSMs (men having sex with men)."}

The ART (antiretroviral therapy) centres and the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) in the city are providing this promised support by turning matchmakers for the single, widowed or even separated HIV-affected people. On World Aids Day, it is a laudatory effort. These centres, link the patients desiring marriage to NGOs that take up the task of bringing together like-minded individuals. A list of these individuals is maintained by the concerned NGO along with the qualities and characteristics they would want in their partners. The success ratio of marriages thus resulting is very high, with only two of the 70 matches since seven years going sour. Yet, those who have gone through the grind have had some adjustments to make, from staging a prenuptial family meeting to calling it a love marriage. Another problem is fewer women than men opting to get married. In the beginning making positive people marry to other positive people was among the ways to prevent the infection from spreading, informed Babita Soni, president of NGO Sanjeevan which is doing the matchmaking since 2005. \"With this option provided to them, the patients would not be marrying people without the disease and still be able to enjoy a normal family life. Once a match is made, we give them a premarital counselling, which includes topics like what to do if they wish to have kids,\" she said. Of the 58 marriages that have been made possible through Sanjeevan's Network of Nagpur by People living with HIV, only two have fallen apart. Another NGO actively participating in this matchmaking process is Positive Women's Network. \"It is important that a positive person marries another positive person because the treatment and medication of the disease is a lifelong process, and it also calls for several lifestyle changes. A person with the same problem can provide better support to the patients,\" said Geeta Gondane, the vice president of the NGO. The list of preferences, she said, could include the desired caste, religion and profession of the spouse. Recently, the NGO had a case where a patient's childhood sweetheart wanted to marry him despite the infection. Fortunately, two years after the marriage, not only is the wife still negative but also the newborn child of the couple. However, such a match requires close monitoring of all aspects of life, so that the negative partner does not acquire the infection. \"It has been six years since we got married. As it was an inter-caste marriage, we had to tell acquaintances that it was a love marriage,\" said Praveen (name changed), who was among the first people to get married this way.

Officials credit better awareness through various means for bringing about this change. Between the years 2002 and 2012, the transmission of the disease from parents to children has gone down from 1.10% to 0.25%. The fall of HIV being detected among people walking into the voluntary counseling and testing centres (VCTC) was even more dramatic, from a whopping 33.55% to a meagre 3.50%. DAPCU has been running various targeted interventions focused on population groups more prone to fall prey to the infection. A team of more than 500 people associated with DAPCU also moves around in various parts of the district imparting knowledge about the disease and its preventive measures through lectures, street plays, skits and brochures. \"From the time we started the ART centre here, in 2001, till today the rate of positivity (or people who are HIV positive) is decreasing progressively. Several misconceptions about AIDS were prevalent at that time which have gone away because of increased awareness, in which the internet has played a major part. Fear has now been replaced by knowledge,\" said Tanuja Fale, district programme officer of DAPCU. Along with our efforts, the credit for this development also goes to the many NGOs that we have partnered with over the years, she added. Targeted interventions include population groups like female sex workers, homosexuals, truckers and migrant workers. DAPCU team also organizes lectures in colleges, corporate firms, government organizations, and even jails. \"We also have a helpline that helps people who can not come to the counselling centres,\" said Fale."}

She came back to her native place to deliver the baby but medical tests revealed that she had acquired HIV. She gave birth to the child who, mercifully, was free of the virus. When she returned to her husband in Mumbai and told him that she had HIV, he threw her out and disowned her. With nowhere to go, she begged at Mumbai Railway station for a few days with her newborn baby. After two days, however, she returned to her parents. To her dismay, even her parents refused to let her into their house. Feeling helpless, Laxmi decided to come to Ahmedabad where her aunt (mausi) lived in Bapu Nagar locality. Her aunt accepted the baby but refused to let Laxmi live with her family. Telling herself that her child would at least have a home, the hapless mother gave the child to her aunt and left. Unable to live with the stigma of HIV and the social boycott that came with the disease, Laxmi decided to end her life. She went to Kalupur Railway station with the thought of jumping in front of a train. But at the railway station she came across the signboard of the NGO, Adhar, which helps HIV positive people cope with the disease. The NGO also runs a marriage bureau for HIV positive people. It helped Laxmi get married for a second time. The UP woman is now married and lives a normal life in Ahmedabad. Laxmi and her husband have decided not to have children. Meanwhile, Laxmi's first husband has died of Aids. (Name has been changed to protect the identity)"}

Alpesh Prajapati, who did his PhD from Gujarat Vidyapith, surveyed a sample of 110 patients for his research. Most of them had been disowned by their respective families, neighbours and friends. The research also reveals that the hostility of society towards such patients has led to the creation of 'silent groups' of patients. These people have been diagnosed as being HIV positive but they do not reveal it and live with the disease as normal men and women. People with HIV find it difficult to make a living if it is known that they are infected. Thus patients find themselves fighting on many fronts at the same time. The worst impact is on the women who are found to have the Aids virus. Alpesh spent four years on research and suggested that a lot has to be done to spread awareness among people to remove the stigma attached to HIV. He has suggested that awareness programmes should be held at schools and in colleges."}

While men constitute a majority, 39% of these infected people are women and 8% are children under 14. As per figures provided by State AIDS Control Society (SACS), number of HIV positive cases has been rising consistently and considerably since 2003. The considerable rise is mainly due to increased awareness about the disease and the wide network of testing labs, which were almost non-existent till a decade ago. In 2003, the state on an average, recorded 3 cases per month, which went up to 125 in 2008 and stands at 252 cases as of date. The number of cases recorded per month in 2009 was 182, 190 in 2010, 213 in 2011 and 242 in 2012. According to the latest data of this fiscal (2013-14), the highest number of HIV positive cases was detected in Raipur, Durg and Bilaspur. Of the 9,825 people tested in Raipur, 466 were found to be HIV positive. Similarly, in Durg and Bilaspur, a total of 15,055 and 20,718 were tested and 298 and 288 were found HIV positive respectively. Talking to TOI, Kshitiz Diwan, SACS official, attributed the rise in number of cases to increased awareness and availability of testing centers. He said since 2008, testing centers have more than doubled from 52 to 111 in 2013. Additional Project director, Dr SK Binjhwar, said there is a need for people with HIV to lead a normal life and contribute to the society, regardless of their infection. He said almost 90 per cent of women get infected with HIV/AIDS from their husband. Thus, there is a dire need for behavioral control and attitude among men. At present, 5,069 people are taking treatment at ART centers. However, 11,782 people affected with AIDS were registered but more than 50% dropped the treatment midway."}

But she faces a dilemma: even if she does find a match, the man would either be a widower or someone twice as old as Kaveri. \"These adolescent girls face a bleak future if they end up into forced marriages. More often than not, they are left with a single parent who wants to get them married quickly,\" says Saroja Putran, a member of the HIV-infected community. Such marriages are not a new phenomenon in rural parts of North Karnataka.

To make matter worse, the District AIDS Prevention Control Unit (DAPCU) has not been able to trace them even. The patients, who have abandoned treatment, are labelled as 'lost to follow-up' (LFU) cases and have a higher mortality risk as compared with those who continue regular anti-retroviral treatment (ART). Once counted among the six high prevalence districts in the state, the ratio of HIV positive patients to that of total tested has declined from 10.07% in 2007 to 2.7% in 2013 in Kolhapur. There are four anti-retroviral treatment centres (ARTs) in the district. DAPCU officials said that of the 207 LFU cases, about 153 were registered at the district civil hospital, 48 at Gadhingalaj ART centre, four at the Ichalkaranji centre and two at the Savitribai Phule KMC hospital. About 127 LFU patients are females. Programme officer of DAPCU Deepa Shipurkar said, \"Around 207 patients are untraceable since 2007, when the first ART centre was started in Kolhapur. The reasons for LFU cases are poor family support, social stigma, logistic problems and economic reasons, which include the cost of travelling to the ART centres.\" She added, \"We are currently collecting all available information regarding these patients and will soon launch a full fledged drive to reach out to these patients.\" Counsellors will visit the homes of these patients and try to convince them and their family members to resume the medications. However, it is difficult to bring them back to the treatment due to the social stigma, health officials said. In August, DAPCU launched the project called 'Vihaan' which ensures that the people living with HIV undergo regular follow-ups on health parameters. The aim of the project is to make patients aware about nutrition, healthy lifestyles and the available social and economic support. In addition, one-on-one counseling and support group meetings will be organized. The project also aims to train service providers and give them periodic feedback on service quality."}

The parent-to-child virus transmission has also come down from 67 in 2012 to 23 this year. There are four anti-retroviral treatment centres (ARTs) and link ARTs across the district to clinically examine the suspected patients. After a person is tested positive, the ART medication starts at the earliest. Jagdish Patil, the regional programme officer of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), told TOI, \"We are targeting those in the high-risk groups such as male and female sex workers, and trans genders, who are most vulnerable, to spread the awareness about the syndrome. As this group is brought under control, the spread of the virus to the secondary population, such as spouses and children of these people, also decreases. We have brought around 90% infected people to ART centres to provide medication which has significantly reduced the spread.\" The District AIDS Prevention Control Unit (DAPCU), along with the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), is going to conduct a survey among those engaged in cutting of sugarcane for HIV infection. \"The sugar cutters are mostly migratory workers and considered the bridge-population for the virus to spread. However, there is no study about how much these people contribute to the spread of virus. However, the population has the potential risk of transmitting the virus through unsafe sex,\" Patil added. Along with the decline in the AIDS cases among the general masses, the district has also recorded a dip in in the parent-to-child transmission of the virus. \"Last year, about 67 children were infected through their HIV -positive mother. This year, the number has been significantly declined because of te co-ordinating efforts of private and public anti-natal care centres. A single-dose regimen of Nevirapin has reduced the transmission rate from 30% to 11%. We will start the triple drug regimen that can bring down the rate further to 2-5%,\" Patil said."}

The first World AIDS day was celebrated 25 years ago. As we celebrate World AIDS Day, there is some good news to report: the rate of HIV infection is declining! Worldwide, 2.3 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2012, down from 3.4 million in 2001. However, there are still an alarming number of people, 35.3 million, living with HIV. Twenty-five years since the first World AIDS Day, the world has made incredible progress in the fight against AIDS. Much has been achieved in recent years, and leaders from around the world have begun to call for the achievement of \"the beginning of the end of AIDS\"- something that would have seemed impossible a decade ago. But achieving the beginning of the end of AIDS won't happen just by repeating the phrase enough times - it takes hard work, political commitment and new resources. Securing more money for HIV/AIDS, however, is only one piece of the broader effort to end the disease. In order to develop a sustainable response to the epidemic, political leadership at the national and local levels is essential. For the past several years, on this particular day of the year, the international reflects upon a theme. This year it's 'Getting to zero: Zero new HIV infections. Zero discrimination. Zero AIDS-related deaths' on the occasion of World AIDS Day. Today, the candles will be lit and pious words will be mouthed as well. A quarter of a century after HIV/AIDS was recognized as a pandemic with multiple dimensions, certain leaders continue to beat that old whipping horse, alternative lifestyles. Even as globally more and more progressive nations are giving same-sex couples legal marital status, there are homophobic demagogues who try to link HIV infections to a LGBT. A recent statement from CARITAS, which on one hand talks about the 'compassion' of the Catholic church towards those living with the virus, also states that the goal of 'Zero new HIV infections' can be attained through 'responsible interpersonal relationships' and individual behaviour, including the limitation of sexual activity to a 'permanent and mutually faithful' marriage between 'one man and one woman' and the 'avoidance of all injecting drug use that has not been prescribed and supervised by healthcare professionals'. In India, the AIDS pandemic brought along with it liberation of sorts. The fact that India and small town India in particular had significant numbers of non-heterosexual people, brought to the fore the ugliness of discriminatory laws such as IPC 377. The fight by some NGOs to ensure that equitable and compassionate access to treatment also reached the panthi, kothi, hijra and kinnar communities, ultimately led to a reading down of the law. The LGBT community in India got a voice and a visibility, thanks to the AIDS pandemic. The government and the authorities could no longer pretend that non-heterosexual people didn't exist in India. In Bihar, there are several concerns that need to be addressed, not the least being the one that deals with blatant discrimination against positive persons, a blatant carelessness with blood products in certain blood banks and the blatant flouting of loopholes that allow certain unregistered establishments to continue to peddle unsafe blood under the radar, points out Sanjeet Singh, an HIV positive activist who uses public interest litigations to have the high court nudge the lethargic medical services into action. The HIV positive kids in Bihar now have access to a scheme that provides for their sustenance. The government has been particularly mindful that HIV positive persons below the poverty line should not be denied entitlements such as Indira Awas and so on. It's still a long haul, but with more and more awareness about HIV and treatment spreading, discrimination and stigma will also shrink, and Bihar's women will be a key factor of change, says social worker Shantwana Bharati from Bihar Mahila Samakhya Society. There are several instances in her book of case studies where simple village women have advocated successfully and curtailed acts of intolerance towards people living with HIV. So, everyone hopes to see new infections going down and better access to treatment for infected people over the next few years. But there's a long way to go. On a political level, our leaders can do much more to ensure that the HIV/AIDS responses are more effective, equitable and free of stigma. Tackling AIDS, particularly among marginalized populations, will in some cases require a sea-change in how these populations are viewed and treated. High-level political endorsement will be critical to ensuring access to services for all."}

According to the officials, around 250 HIV positive deliveries take place in Vizag district every year. As per the PPCT treatment, HIV testing is conducted on all pregnant women and if found positive, anti-retroviral treatment (ART) is administered from the 14th week of pregnancy, irrespective of the CD4 count. Right after birth, Nevirapine and Septran syrup are given to the baby. Blood tests (DBS-PCR tests) are also done from time to time till the child is one-and-half-years old. If the child tests HIV negative, then he or she can be said to be free from HIV transmission. Breastfeeding is also encouraged since the mother is kept on ART drugs. Additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy) Dr Ronanki Ramesh said, \"Currently, around 8,000 HIV positive pregnant women are undergoing ART in Vizag as per the government records. We are focusing on zero vertical transmission of the virus from the mother to the newborn and therefore implementing PPCT in every possible antenatal case. This advanced drug regime was introduced on September 2012 as a pilot project in AP and Karnataka and now the success rate is almost 98%. We will soon conduct sensitization workshops for private gynaecologists so that PPCT is followed in every case.\" Besides a decrease in vertical transmission in antenatal cases, focus is given on bringing down HIV-TB co-infections. \"Since HIV patients develop tuberculosis as an opportunistic infection, we are focusing on such patients too so that incidence of HIV-TB can be brought down. The three ART centres and 15 Link ART centres in the district along with a few NGOs are playing a crucial role in controlling HIV in newborns and TB patients due to timely treatment,\" added the ADMHO.

New infections among adolescents could be halved by 2020 by scaling up high-impact interventions and working across sectors. The treatment, care and support needs of children living with HIV change as they grow older and begin to take greater responsibility for their own health. But services generally do not keep pace with or cater to their needs. This is particularly true for marginalized adolescents males who have sex with males, adolescents who inject drugs and sexually exploited adolescents despite the disproportionately high prevalence of HIV among them. Experts have advised a combination of high-impact interventions including condoms, antiretroviral treatment, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, voluntary medical male circumcision, communications for behaviour change, and targeted approaches for at-risk and marginalized populations. This is in addition to investments in other sectors such as education, social protection and welfare, and strengthening health systems."}

Just when United Nations AIDS (UNAIDS) has praised India for reducing new HIV infection rate by 57% in a decade, news from Mumbai shows that the number of patients put on life-saving drugs has almost doubled in the last five years. Figures released by the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) on the eve of World AIDS Day show that 36,920 HIV patients in the city have been put on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) over the years. The therapy has been instrumental in changing the perception of AIDS from being a death sentence to a manageable chronic disease. \"This is a 96.2% increase in the number of patients taking ART since 2008,\" said Dr B Adsul, additional project director at MDACS. The numbers show that the AIDS-control programme is spreading wider into the community. The city's government-aided AIDS control programme has registrations of 67,326 patients across the city. \"In the last five years, we have managed to increase the number of patients coming to us for treatment by 60%,'' added Dr Adsul. That HIV-positive individuals are living healthier lives can be gauged from the fact almost 40% of the registered patients don't need ART yet, said a MDACS official. This means their blood counts aren't yet plunging to levels that need ART,'' they said. The MDACS, which works under the civic bodymunicipal corporation of Greater Mumbai, operates 69 centres for testing and counselling patients as well as 10 centres to distribute ART medicines. In the last five years, the number of people getting themselves checked for the disease has gone up by 39% and the HIV positivity among these patients has decreased by 56%.

Surve, art director at a leading publishing house, pledged to support Dhawale, 38, in her fight to lift the stigma off AIDS, and gradually tweak the mindset of those around them by being a model \u2018mixed status\u2019 couple. And that\u2019s not the only stereotype they are crashing. Dhawale is no emaciated, drawn HIV victim. She fills up the room when she hurries in. \u201cI can\u2019t hear,\u201d she says, motioning to her hearing aid. Her eardrums were damaged in a car accident when she was three. But her hardest struggle has been to fight the stigma that came with the HIV virus she contracted eight years ago due to medical negligence. The three abortions she underwent between 2004 and 2006 (\u201cOral contraceptive made me nauseous and my ex-husband didn\u2019t care for condoms\u201d) did her in. The homemaker, blogger and HIV activist believes infected surgical implements may have been used. \u201cPoz? Me? Not possible. There has to be a mistake,\u201d she writes on her blog, recounting receiving the test results when she went in for her fourth abortion. That she had destroyed records of all three previous surgeries meant she couldn\u2019t hold anyone accountable. \u201cThe nursing home staff suggested I have the baby because it was my last chance due to the complications the serial abortions had led to.\u201d Until then, Dhawale admits, she knew nothing about the Human Immunodeficiency Virus which triggers the progressive failure of the immune system, allowing life-threatening infections to thrive. \u201cI thought it only happened to those with multiple partners. I didn\u2019t have them, neither did my husband.\u201d The Vasai clinic she delivered her baby at (he is seven years old now), administered Zidovudine, an antiretroviral drug, to prevent transmission of virus from mother to child. Her marriage ended in 2007 \u2014 \u201cdue to incompatibility, not the infection\u201d, she clarifies \u2014 making her isolation complete. The counselling centre run by Kripa Foundation that she was directed to was ill equipped to empower patients with accurate information about medicine dosage, side effects or the nature of the virus. She realised she had to know more. The online information space was one she chose to dip into between 2010 and 2011, sparking off her transformation. Dhawale learnt that virus transmission didn\u2019t stand a chance if partners stayed healthy and the infected person kept the virus count low with medication. \u201cIn India, abstinence is the only solution experts offer,\u201d she says, recounting how an \u2018AIDS specialist\u2019 she visited in 2012 advised Surve, who was then her boyfriend, against kissing her. \u201cHe even suggested we wear gloves while being intimate. Even if traces of the virus exist in the saliva, it cannot be transmitted unless one or both partners have bleeding gums or open sores. It\u2019s the same during oral sex unless one partner suffers from an STD or the viral load is at a detectable level,\u201d she clarifies. In fact, it was during her time online that she met Surve. The two hit it off, and eventually she told him she was HIV+ve. \u201cHe disappeared for three months,\u201d she giggles. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d he says. \u201cBut not a single day went by when I did not think of her.\u201d Surve, who Dhawale says on her blog, had dilly dallied for two-anda-half years, offered a commitment this August when she was ironically preparing to participate at an HIV matrimonial meet in Pune. Expectedly, there was resistance from Surve\u2019s family. After all, she had a \u2018sex worker\u2019s\u2019 disease. \u201cWe tell people on a need-to-know basis, and educate them on how it\u2019s transmitted,\u201d says Surve, who admits that it\u2019s family and close friends who are aware that they are a serodiscordent couple. That Dhawale never let the virus rob her vivacity has made sure the couple enjoy a \u201crocking, fearless but protected sex life\u201d. \u201cThere are procedures to follow in case of a condom tear, pills you can take within 72 hours of the act, under the doctor\u2019s guidance,\u201d explains Surve. Their constant effort is to keep the virus load down, reducing any chance of transmission. The medicines that Dhawale takes twice a day at times so precise, the couple set an alarm for it, are personalised based on her lifestyle, and blood, liver parameters. \u201cIf you miss a dose, the virus will multiply. If you overdose, the hormones go for a toss,\u201d he says. Does the fear of untimely death hang over the couple? \u201cWith proper exercise, diet and medication,\u201d he says, \u201can HIV+ve person can outlive an HIV-ve one. We are making sure Jyoti does.\u201d Ways to prevention Always use a condom. Have your partner tested for HIV before engaging in a physical relationship and/or marriage. Insist that labs, clinics and hospitals use disposable syringes and screens."}

However, the bad news in disguise is that the rate has increased from 0.21% in 2010. An official of JSACS said on condition of anonymity that the rising number of cases can be controlled only through awareness programmes. \"The main reason for the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the state is migration and trafficking along with lack of awareness about the disease. Most of the time people from rural areas go to other states to work as labourers and get (infected by) HIV and when they come back, they, at times, transmit it to those whom they come in contact with,\" he said. The adult HIV prevalence rate in the state was only 0.14% in 2007, which increased to 0.16% in 2008, 0.18% in 2009, 0.21% in 2010 and now to 0.25% in 2011. On the other hand, the national average of adult HIV prevalence rate declined from 0.33% in 2007 to 0.31% in 2008, 0.30% in 2009 and 0.28% in 2010 and now to 0.27% in 2011. According to the Naco HIV Estimate Report 2012, there were 23,800 HIV positive patients in the state in 2007, which increased to 28,300 in 2008, 33,800 in 2009, 40,200 in 2010 and 48,000 in 2011. In India, number of HIV positive people has declined from 22.5 lakh in 2007 to 21.9 lakh in 2008, 21.4 lakh in 2009, 21.1 lakh in 2010 and 20.9 lakh in 2011. The report also says number of HIV positive cases registered in Jharkhand in 2011 is the third highest among other states. \"We will take out a rally on Sunday on the occasion of World AIDS Day to spread awareness among people,\" said the official quoted above. The Jharkhand State AIDS Control Society (JSACS) has taken various steps for prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS. There are 64 Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTC) in the state and six anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres. Besides adults, these six ART centres cater to 844 children below 15 years of age. The additional project director of JSACS, BP Chaurasia, was not available for comment."}

He will first see his regular patients at his clinic in Nalaband Chowk here, and then counsel those who are still trying to come to terms with their medical condition. But that's not the clincher. The 57-year-old has been tirelessly treating the poor and the needy affected by HIV for free for over 10 years. His acts of kindness have reportedly touched 10,000 lives, especially children and women. He also keeps aside about 10% of his salary to treat people living with HIV. Dr Patil, who hails from Aheri village in Bijapur taluk, found that his true calling lay in the field of HIV/AIDS treatment soon after he finished his specialization in skin diseases at Mysore. His training at St Joseph's Medical College, Swamy Vivekananda Institute and an NGO working on preventing infections helped him take the road less travelled. As he treats his patients day in and day out, he has also been working on getting rid of the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. \"I always wanted to give back to society. My father, who was a teacher, has been my inspiration throughout. Our society should not stigmatize those affected by AIDS. It is just a type of disease; nothing else.\" Ravi Kittur, a counsellor at the district hospital, says the doctor also makes time out of his busy schedule to visit villages once a month to check up on his patients. \"He also refers those who need further diagnosis or treatment and are hard put to other specialists who offer concessions. He takes extra care of patients from rural areas.\" To fulfil his aim, Dr Patil floated an NGO - Sri Gurukrupa Seva Samsthe - in the name of his late father, which creates awareness about HIV/AIDS in rural areas. Surekha (name changed), a former patient of Dr Patil, says she has been closely watching the doctor at work for about two years. \"Patients in rural areas look forward to his visits. They feel free to discuss their problems and conditions with him and pay heed to his suggestions.\" Before his launched his clinic, Dr Patil worked as an honorary doctor with an NGO and served at the community care centre attached to the district hospital. Support for those affected by HIV, he says, goes a long way in ensuring their long lives."}

In 2008, the prevalence of the virus among antenatal attendees was recorded at 0.13 per cent. Addressing a meeting on the eve of World AIDS Day on Saturday, state epidemiologist of ASACS Chiranjeev Bhattacharjee said, \"In Assam, a rising trend in HIV prevalence, especially among pregnant women, has been observed but it is still lower when compared to other groups. The evidence suggests that the HIV epidemic in the state is mainly driven by bridge populations such as migrants and the truckers.\" He said the absence of sentinel sites to monitor HIV prevalence among truckers and migrants is responsible for the limited data on their role in the spread of HIV from high risk groups to the general populace. Assam has about 8,580 HIV positive cases, out of which around 5,229 are male, 2948 are female, seven are transgender and 396 are children."}

Richa is just 18 and had been diagnosed with HIV positive. And like Richa, several youngsters in their adolescence had been diagnosed with HIV in the last one and a half years. According to the data available with the Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) Centre in civil hospital, about 500 patients aged 15 and 24 years, under the category of adolescents, have been admitted since the last one-and-a-half years. According to the present report, there are 3,700 patients being treated at the ART centre in Ludhiana, out of which 500 are adolescents between the age group of 15 and 24. Two major hospitals- Dayanand Medical College and Hospital and Christian Medical College and Hospital in the city also report their HIV positive cases to the ART centre. These numbers have varied during the last four year since the ART centre was launched on December 17, 2009. Initially, the ART centre used to receive about 10-20 cases of adolescents over the years. But now the figures have increased and the centre currently treats 500 registered cases. Talking about the tremendously increasing figures of HIV positive among the adolescents in last four years in city centre, Gurjit Singh, SMO, ART centre, said, \"At present, around 500 cases of HIV positive in adolescents are being treated here. According to data, there are two major reasons that have been found to be the reason behind the disease a?? the first being drug abuse and the second being unprotected sex or sex with more than one partner.\" According to experts, an overview of the data reveals that out of the 3,700 HIV cases being treated, 87% are cases of sexual infection, 5-10% of drug abuse, and others due to infection from mother to child and blood transfusion. In case of adolescents, 70% cases happen due to sexual activity and rest due to drug abuse. Vikas Garg, assistant professor medicine from Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, said, \"We receive about 10-20 HIV patients every month, of which adolescents make up for the major number of confirmed cases. The reason behind the increase in these cases is that even after widespread awareness about HIV/AIDS, people do not take it seriously. Drug abuse as the major reason in city had been spreading fast among the adolescents. They mainly get affected by sharing the used syringes, which many a times may be infected. And as the infected person is more prone to opportunistic infections, it leads to other diseases.\" Talking about the root cause of cases, Navjot Singh, professor and unit head department of medicine, CMC, said, \"There is only one way to cure this problem, which is by starting treatment as soon as it is diagnosed. Although, an HIV positive person is mostly left with little time, proper and timely treatment can help improve many cases.\" Besides this, some homosexual cases too had been registered, but their numbers could be said to be in negligible condition in the state and city. An overview of data from the Civil Hospital shows that when the ART centre started diagnosing HIV cases, about 720 cases were reported, while now the numbers have increased to 3,700 in the city."}

According to US Sooch, the head of DAPCU in Ludhiana, truckers of all ages are among the most vulnerable groups. They frequently get involved in unprotected sex with sex workers, and also consume drugs, which makes them doubly vulnerable to AIDS. At the Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) Centre in Ludhiana, there are more than 150 HIV-positive truckers who are being treated. Lauding the event, Ashok Bawa, the president of the Transporters Association, said: \"I am happy they chose this city for an AIDS awareness programme, as most of the truckers are not educated and knowledgeable about how to deal with this situation. They are completely unaware of the facts about how this disease can be transmitted from one person to another.\" At the programme, the truckers were provided the facility of being checked on the spot for HIV. Condoms were also distributed to them to protect them from the disease that can take the life of a person. Four truckers tested HIV-positive in the check-up inside the NACO van."}

If the positive cases were about 1,245 in 2007 about 90 cases being reported per month, including pregnant women, now the cases are averaging less 50 per month,\" said Dr Kishore Kumar M, District AIDS Control officer. He pointed out that while in 2007, the test to positive ration was 16% in 2013 it has come to as low as 1.45%. Delineating the statistics, he said, \"In 2007 of the 7,986 persons tested 1,245 were tested positive, in 2013 (till October end) of the 38,985 tested only 567 were positive cases. Last year, as many as 38,294 went in for testing and there were 867 cases. This year, we expect the test number to reach 44,000,\" he said. Dr Kishore said the positive development was that every year from 2007 the cases were coming down by more than 100, hoping to achieve better progress in next couple of years. The most heartening fact is the effective control of transmission of HIV from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy. Nearly five per cent of infections are attributable to parent-to-child-transmission. Dr Kishore pointed out that froma high of 82 cases in 2007 among 14,764 pregnant women tested, the numbers had come down to 23 in 2012 among 23,575 tested. This year till October 21 cases have been reported among 22,141 tested. Among the cases reported this year till October, Mangalore taluk has the highest number at 214, followed by Bantwal (51), Belthangady (45), Puttur 927) and Sullia taluk reported 15 cases. The rest of the 215 cases are from other districts tested here. Again male numbers are high at 364 followed by women at 203. The prevalence among persons in the age group of 15 to 49 is highest at 472 and it is 80 above age of 49. As of now, from 2006 till date 2,492 persons are being administered ART (Anti-Retroviral Treatment). Dr Kishore said HIV management suggests that antiretroviral therapy should be recommended to those with HIV whose CD4 cell counts are below 350 cells/mm3. Earlier the threshold was 250. Antiretroviral treatment boosts the immune system and reduces the risks of HIV-related death and disease. It also lowers the risk of co-infection like tuberculosis."}

Belgaum, Bagalkot and Bijapur districts are considered a high-risk zone for HIV/AIDS. Any special measures for these districts? It's turned into a high-risk zone due to backwardness and poor standard of living and awareness. The other reason is migration of people from Maharashtra and Goa. We'll focus more on these high-risk zones."}

The HIV-2 strain, is common in west African countries like Senegal, Sierra Leone, Ghana and is rarely found outside the African continent. The HIV-2 virus, is considered more vicious compared to the HIV-1 virus. In the last six months alone, about 67 samples sent to Institute of Preventive Medicines (IPM) by the APSACS (Andhra Pradesh State AIDS Control Society) have tested positive. Furthermore, dozens of samples are currently awaiting confirmation for the presence of the virus. The IPM uses the more accurate western blot method for detection of the virus. Even private hospitals are getting cases of patients affected with the virus. \"It is a fact that few even in the medical profession are not adequately informed about the HIV-2 virus,\" said Sunita Narreddy from the infection diseases specialty of Apollo Hospitals where about five cases of HIV-2 were recorded this year. \"Though HIV-1 and HIV-2 belong to the same family, the two differ in terms of their testing methodologies and treatment. Testing is comparatively easier for the HIV-1 virus unlike the HIV-2 virus. Also, there are better treatment options for HIV-1 virus compared to the latter,\" said Narreddy. Although the method of transmission for both the viruses is same, medicines to treat HIV-1 patients do not work for HIV-2 patients. This explains the fact that there are currently no medicines that the government is prescribing for HIV-2 patients. \"Medicines for treating HIV-2 virus are still in the testing stages, There are no approved drugs that work for this virus anywhere in the world. Hence, we cannot risk a patient's life by administering any drugs at this point of time,\" said a government official of the state health department. In India, there have been a few cases of HIV-2 being reported from some pockets in and around Mumbai. \"We cannot explain how this virus spread to this state. But, the numbers are higher in certain areas of Guntur district.\" said a member of an organization working on the HIV programmes. There have also been some cases of the same person carrying both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 virus. According to the state records, about 5 lakh people have been identified as HIV positive in the state."}

In 2012-13, out of 440 million condoms, 109 million was given to AP while the remaining 331 was distributed among other 27 states as per information from AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS). While these figures are indicative of greater awareness and health seeking behaviour among the vulnerable population to arrest the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI), the chances of misuse and wastage can't also be ruled out according to medical experts. In AP there are around five lakh people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA). Again at least 60 % of these allocated condoms are distributed to vulnerable districts where incidences of HIV and targeted interventions (TI) are more. According to APSACS, these include the nine coastal districts, Warangal, Khammam, Anantapur, Karimnagar and Chittoor. \"Though initially, there was some resistance from certain people due to religious issues or social customs, gradually they understood the importance of using condoms and practicing safe sex, which in turn brought down new incidences of HIV-AIDS and STI among various high risk groups (HRG),\" averred T Kailashditya, joint director (TI), APSACS. In the last 3 to 5 years, incidence of STI has plummeted from 18% to 2% among the HRGs, HIV rate has come down from 11% to 7% among female sex workers, from 23% to 10% among MSMs (men having sex with men), from 7% to 3.75% among injectable drug users while among ante-natal women it has come down from 1.22% to 0.77%, as per data from APSACS. \"The 176 targeted interventions among various HRGs and link workers scheme in 19 districts, ICTC (Integrated counselling and testing centres) services, free distribution of condoms and AIDS education and counselling even in 1,300 primary health centres in the state have enhanced the awareness levels of people,\" pointed out Dr Jayachandra Reddy, joint director, basic services, APSACS. Dr Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (ADMHO), Vizag, added, \"Due to the greater usage of condoms, including female condoms, among the HRG, the incidence of new HIV infections is also coming down. Since, people were apprehensive of the quality of freely distributed condoms from the government, NACO is now into social marketing of condoms to inculcate the habit of purchasing these among public. A pack of three condoms comes at a nominal cost of Rs 4 and 80-90% of the HRG are using it. However, some doctors are skeptical about the claims of the state government regarding condom usage and control of HIV. They point to misuse and wastage of condoms. Padmasri Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao and a specialist in treating HIV patients, said, \"Greater demand for condoms does not imply that there is high awareness among the general public. It's also indicative of increased sexual promiscuity and wastage of free condoms distributed by the government. We have come across households where free condoms are just discarded or the children inflate these as balloons and play. Even in 2012, 4.19 lakh HIV cases were detected in AP.\" But ruling out chances of wastage, Kailashditya claimed, \"We have mechanisms to ensure that the condoms are not misused or wasted. Peer educators ensure that adequate number of condoms is distributed to HRGs while NACO's outlet boxes are kept in HIV hotspots for people to pick up free condoms whenever they require.\""}

Dr Dilip Mathai, vice president of the AIDS Society of India, said the SC verdict was a setback for medical care for HIV patients who are men who have sex with men (MSMs). \u201cOur focus is to minimise new cases, but this verdict will make the act more clandestine and prevent doctors from reaching out to gay men who have HIV,\u201d explained Dr Mathai. He added: \u201cThe homosexual act will not disappear but the community seeking help will reduce drastically. Now while treating male patients, doctors cannot ask, \u2018Have you indulged in sex with a man,\u2019 and this will have a major impact on detecting new cases.\u201d Dr Kabir Sardana of Delhi\u2019s Maulana Azad Medical College too said that gay patients suffering from STDs may no longer report their illness for fear of being branded an outlaw. In one of its report, the Human Rights Watch had highlighted the bitter truth that India\u2019s battle against HIV/AIDS was made harder by the criminality attached to vulnerable communities. Some of the challenges underscored were thankfully overcome owing to the Delhi HC ruling in 2009 decriminalising gay sex. But, with the latest SC verdict, the obstacles will get resurrected. The issue is particularly pressing. MSMs are a high-risk category for HIV/AIDS. About 7% of the estimated 25-lakh gay persons in India are HIV-infected, according to the Central government. Their marginalization in healthcare was in fact the basis of the public interest litigation filed by the Naz Foundation in Delhi HC. The National AIDS Control Organisation too had conceded in the HC that Section 377 seriously impeded successful public health interventions. \u201cThose in the high-risk group are reluctant to reveal same-sex behaviour due to the fear of law enforcement agencies, keeping a large section invisible and unreachable and thereby pushing the cases of infection underground, making it very difficult for public health workers to even access them,\u201d stated the affidavit. The Human Rights Watch report cited an instance from July 2001, when four NGO staffers in Lucknow working to fight HIV/AIDS among MSMs were arrested and charged under IPC Section 377 (unnatural offences) and for selling obscene material. They were imprisoned for 47 days. Their literature was seized. And the offices of their two NGOs, Naz Foundation and Bharosa Trust, were sealed. The harassment they suffered has been endured over the years by scores of other health workers in Chennai, Bangalore and Delhi. \u201cThis (verdict) will have a devastating impact on the fight against HIV/AIDS. In the early days, it was very hard to get MSMs to health units, as they feared police action. This changed only after the Delhi HC judgment,\u201d said Dr L Ramakrishnan of Solidarity and Action Against the HIV Infection in India. Dr Ramakrishnan said the SC ruling was likely to give legal backing to the biases of some healthcare professionals and fuel their discriminatory attitudes. The Anti Retroviral Therapy centre in the Government General Hospital in Chennai had seen a rise in gay patients with HIV coming to them for treatment after the Delhi HC verdict in 2009. \u201cThe number MSMs approaching NGOs doubled from 4% to 8%,\u201d said a senior doctor at the hospital. Bhavana, programme manager of Sahodaran, a male sexual health project, said: \u201cIf homosexuality is legalised, we can freely distribute condoms to same sex couples. It would have also encouraged people to come out. This verdict will have a negative impact on intervention programmes.\u201d (With inputs from Kamini Mathai, Madhavi Rajadhyaksha, Durgesh Nandan Jha)"}

At the focus of most such programmes is what is coded as MSM, or men having sex with men. Will criminalizing of homosexuality mean that these activities become illegal, too? Will this mean that the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) would require dropping this huge and vulnerable population group out of their future plans? Such questions are haunting several individuals and organizations working towards HIV awareness and reduction. \"For decades, we have worked towards bringing out the hidden population of LGBTQ community to speak about their sexual problems in order to bring down the number of HIV cases amongst them. Now, even if we were to go somewhere to create awareness or discuss a project, it would be likened to encouraging an illegal activity,\" said Kunal Maind, programme manager of NGO Saarthi Trust. This will result in an increase in HIV cases as gay people would fear to come out, which ultimately will be the society's loss, he added. Questioning the intent and legality of the services and counselling provided to the community by these NGOs is a major worry among them. \"Our field workers are scared that if they go out for any awareness activity, the society will not accept them. Most importantly, they fear for their safety as police or anti-social elements can exploit this situation,\" said Amitgiri Goswami, project manager of GAURAV TI project. In the absence of follow-up of this very vulnerable group of population and awareness among them, there would be an increase in the risk factors, thus taking up the number of people affected by the infection, he feared. \"Awareness about safe sex has remained limited to the urban areas till now,\" said Vishal Gajbhiye of NGO Aborigine Bahuuddeshiya Sanstha that had taken up a project to spread this awareness to the rural areas in August. \"In the last three months, we have found 4 positive cases out of 55 random check ups we did. None of them knew anything about safe sex options. With this verdict scaring them further, will we ever be able to achieve the 'taking HIV to zero' target,\" he said. The number game Since 2007, the MSM members are served by Saarthi trust. Services include regular STI and HIV screening, general medical checkups, providing condoms and lubes, linking them with social entitlement schemes, assisting education, help getting jobs and counseling, among others."}

Closed-group communities, NGOs and activists working for gay rights termed the apex court order \"a regressive move which would not only set the country back in terms of social inclusivity, but would increase health issues among the minority group\". Bindumadhav Khire, president of Samapathik Trust, an organization that works for men's sexual health, said, \"Now, the number of cases of unsafe sex is bound to increase, as members of the LGBT community would be scared of coming out in the open. This also means an increase in the number of HIV-AIDS cases.\" Tinesh Chopade, manager of the HIV-prevention project within the Trust, said the community members would fear discussing their health issues openly. \"After the Delhi high court order of 2009, we had seen an increase in the number of LGBT people approaching us with their medical problems. At our level, we have conducted free-of-charge tests for sexually-transmitted infections. We even distributed condoms besides counselling them about safe sex. All that is bound to change, and change for the worse,\" Chopade said. The data related to sexual health of the community members speaks for itself. Vivek Tigote, project director in Samapathik Trust, said, \"Since 2009, the rate of HIV within the LGBT community declined from 8% to 4.3%. More and more people were willing to come out in the open and discuss their medical issues with doctors. Now, it will send the members of the community into hiding again.\" S T Pardeshi, medical officer of the Pune Municipal Corporation, said the LGBT community is more susceptible to sexually-transmitted diseases. \"The civic body is keen to counsel and guide them. We regularly conduct information sessions in colleges and in red-light areas about safe sex practices. The PMC is willing to help them, but a majority of them hide behind a veil of secrecy,\" Pardeshi said. Globally, it has been proven that criminalization of any kind of sexual act leads to an increase in the risk of HIV among its practitioners, said Sanjay Pujari, director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases. Pujari said the SC order is going to be detrimental for the medical health of the community. \"Since the Delhi HC order of 2009, I have met many HIV patients who are very open and upfront about their sexual orientation. They are a minority group, and because of the nature of their sexual activity, the LGBT community is at a higher risk of acquiring HIV. It's thus imperative that HIV prevention programmes reach them, which I feel will become difficult now as they would be unwilling to speak openly,\" he said."}

Apart from this, activists who are carrying on advocacy programme for safe sex and AIDS awareness in the region for the prevention of HIV feel that the decision will cripple the efforts for fighting against the dreaded disease to a great extent. One such activist Abhinav Singh said: \"The decision may give rise to stigmatization of those who are in such relationships. Activists will find it even more difficult to develop the trust factor and rapport building with these people. Now that being homosexual is a criminal offence, coming forward to accept their status in the process of getting registered in order to seek help from the agencies that work for HIV prevention, will not be easy by the LGBT people. It means that now even for the government to be able to reach such people and make them aware about HIV prevention will become all the more difficult.\" Upendra Singh, team leader, technical support unit, Uttar Pradesh State Aids Control Society (UPSACS) said: \"At present, target intervention (TI) programmes are being run in as many as 45 districts, success of whose depends on how many people are coming and opening up with us. It is unfortunate what the SC has said and it will have implications on our mission against AIDS in the long run.\" Prem Prakash Srivastava, project officer, Comprehensive Area Development Society (CADS) under UPSACS, said: \"It will definitely impact the advocacy programme for safe sex and AIDS awareness. Homosexuals are a very closed and tight-lipped community. But after homosexuality was decriminalised more and more people were comfortable talking about it which made our work a bit easy but now with the SC verdict, homosexuals will close up again. The incidence of HIV is high in homosexuals and it is important to keep going with advocacy programmes to strengthen our fight against HIV-AIDS nevertheless. Meanwhile, the recent decision by supreme court that set aside the high court's decision of decriminalizing homosexuality though has drawn ire of many progressive quarters but many of them have welcomed the decision including practicing psychiatrics. According to the president of the SAARC Psychiatric Federation and also the head of Indian Psychiatric Society Dr Indira Sharma, the SC judgement is welcome and should be appreciated in letter and spirit and it is sad that some people are not able to appreciate the same. The grounds that Sharma uses to support her view on the matter include, the enlistment of homosexuality as a mental disorder in international classifications of mental disorders till 1973.\" In 1973, the term 'Homosexuality' was replaced by ' Sexual Orientation Disturbance' in international classification. And even at present a substantial proportion of psychiatrists maintain that homosexuality both consensual and non-consensual is a mental disorder and there are enough scientific evidence to support this view that has accrued over decades\" opined the doctor who is also the head of child and adolescent psychiatry unit, department of psychiatry, Institute of Medical Sciences (IMS), Banaras Hindu university (BHU). Further the doctor said that a significant numbver of homosexuals visit seek medical help as they are quite disturbed by their sexual orientaion and want to change this to heterosexual.\" Though some experts see homosexuality as a form of social deviance, the debate on whether it is a mental disorder is still alive in the field of psychological science. One of the most negative aspect of such orientation is that it may weaken the institution of marriage and is against the order of the nature\" observed the doctor who added that an upsurge in the cases of homosexuality may be attributed to some extent to the modern culture. As per Sharma, the medical needs should not be neglected in such cases. She also said that the issue is highly controversial and needs more discussion with respect to the Indian Penal Code (IPC), on whether the section pertaining to it should be retained, modified or repealed."}

In 2013, 38 babies born to HIV positive mothers tested negative in Trichy. Since the beginning of this year, 'Nevirapine' tablets were administered to HIV-positive mothers 76 hours before delivery while babies were administered Nevirapine syrup from the time of their birth at all ART centres. Though that type of treatment was useful to bring down the number of births of HIV-positive babies, the Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS) that decided to eradicate it completely, made a change in the treatment method. As per the new method, the Nevirapine tablets should be taken by HIV-positive mothers for 14 weeks during pregnancy and the babies should be given Nevirapine syrup for at least six months. Dr Manivannan, medical officer of the ART centre in Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH), Trichy said that the new regimen of treatment was proved to be effective to ensure the birth of HIV-negative babies born to HIV-positive mothers. \"We work towards achieving the target of nil birth of HIV-positive babies in 2015. We hope it will be possible to reach the target with the present mode of treatment to the HIV-positive mothers. With this method, we can bring down the rate of possibility of babies getting affected to one to two percent from the previous rate of 20 per cent,\" he said. In 2012, 45 babies were born to HIV-positive mothers. However, only one baby tested positive and the rest of them tested negative. It is unfortunate that in most of the cases the HIV-positive mothers are victims of marriage with HIV-positive men. At the time of marriage, women are not made aware whether their partners are HIV-positive. On the other hand, the men are also lethargic to go for HIV test before marriage. \"When it is found during pregnancy check-up that a woman is HIV-positive, it comes as a shock to them. But many of the uneducated people from rural areas are not bothered about it. At the same time, the educated people from urban areas completely collapse. So, we have to provide counselling to them to give morale booster,\" said Dr Manivannan who appealed to all the married women to undergo HIV test. The blood of the new born baby is tested through dry blood sample (DBC) method at the Tuberculosis Centre in Chennai. Normally, the presence of HIV virus can be confirmed only after 18 months of delivery. However, Dr Manivannan said that the results through DBC method would almost be the same as the results that come after 18 months."}

This is not the only case. Despite numerous awareness programmes, AIDS is spreading its tentacles in the hill state as well. While a total of 5,700 people here are known to be HIV positive, 429 have succumbed to AIDS according to government records. \"These are the cases that have been reported from across the state between 2002 and 2013. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of more such cases which have not been reported yet,\" Additional Project Director, Uttarakhand State AIDS Control Society (USACS), Dr Meenakshi Uniyal, said. According to reports, nearly 70% of the transmission in the state was through unhygienic and multiple sexual relations. \"One of the reasons for the rising number of HIV positive cases in the state is increase in the migration of people to neighbouring states for employment. Use of injectable drugs is another reason. The number is also increasing because of increasing awareness and more people getting tested for HIV voluntarily,\" Joint Director, Information Education and Communication (IEC), USACS, Uma Prashad explained. Statistics indicate that above 90% of the affected people in the state were those who had migrated in search of jobs to other states. According to government records, a total of 3,500 HIV positive people in the state are presently registered at various Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) centres and a total of 1,810 are taking free of cost treatment for the ailment. Close to 40 NGOs are currently working in the field of HIV/AIDS in the hill state. Four districts \u2014Dehradun, Haridwar, Uddham Singh Nagar and Nainital\u2014have already been declared as HIV 'sensitive'. Officials added that a large number of the reported HIV/AIDS cases in the state are that of pregnant women. \"A total of 22 pregnant women in the state have been found HIV positive this year alone. The deadly virus in most of these cases came from their HIV positive husbands, who had migrated to other states for employment,\" Uniyal added. In view of increasing number of HIV positive cases amongst drug addicts, particularly students and adolescents, the state government has set up five Oral Supplement Therapy (OST) centres, which offer free counselling and medicines to people addicted to drugs."}

In the interim, #JustineSacco and #HasJustineLandedYet began trending on Twitter, especially in the United States, Europe and South Africa. Upon landing in South Africa, Sacco deleted the message and her Twitter account with no comment. But on Sunday, she issued a statement, sending it to South African newspaper The Star and US broadcaster ABCNews, apologizing. \u201cWords cannot express how sorry I am, and how necessary it is for me to apologize to the people of South Africa, who I have offended due to a needless and careless tweet,\u201d she wrote.

Lack of awareness and social stigma pose the greatest obstacles in a vulnerable state like Assam. Prominent activist Jahnabi Goswami, the first woman from the northeast to declare herself HIV positive, rued that the social conditions are not conducive to fighting the disease. \"It is very unfortunate that we have failed to create mass awareness regarding HIV. If we continue to be secretive about the disease, we cannot stop it from spreading,\" Goswami, who realized that she was infected with HIV in 1996, told reporters during an interactive session at the Guwahati Press Club, on Saturday. Even professionals like doctors and health practitioners are not adequately aware, Goswami said, citing examples of how a Guwahati-based private hospital had refused to provide treatment to a 14-year-old boy and his mother because they were HIV positive. \"It's strange how professional people behave even now. If they continue to spread intolerance, how we can expect the lay man to know about the disease? Several people still shy away from disclosing that they are infected, fearing social stigma. HIV positive people like us have to be vocal if we want to stop this disease from spreading further,\" Jahnabi, who runs the Assam Network of Positive People (ANPP), an NGO to create awareness and to facilitate treatment of HIV positive people, said. She lauded the proactive role played by the churches in Mizoram in this regard. The scenario is not as encouraging in Assam, with religious and social institutions not showing much interest in spreading awareness about HIV. According to the Assam State AIDS Control Society, the tate currently has an estimated 12,804 HIV positive people, of which 396 are children Though there has been a countrywide decline of 50 per cent in the numbers, she said the infection of young people is a matter of concern. Jahnabi added that diagnostic or testing centres should target areas in the interior of the state so that the disease can be detected early as it is easier to treat. In the last stage, response to treatment becomes difficult. Goswami was born in 1976 and was brought up at Kampur village in Nagaon district. At the age of 18, she was married to a Guwahati-based businessman in 1994, without 'checking his antecedents.' In 1995, her husband passed away, leaving behind Jahnabi and their three-month-old daughter, Kastorika."}

Talking to TOI, director ASC Prof H K Sharma said that in 2007, UGC had sanctioned Rs 40 lakh for the ASC under the XIth Five Year Plan. The commission had allocated Rs 75 lakh to all universities that already had ASC and communicated that once the university concerned spends Rs 75 lakh and settles the expenditure, the UGC would provide another Rs 75 lakh for enhancing facilities for the faculty members coming to university concerned for refresher courses at ASC and other activities of the college. Under the scheme, the AU too received Rs 40 lakh. The UGC assured that the remaining amount of the sanctioned Rs 75 lakh would be provided once the varsity utilizes the amount. The then ASC director Prof Pratima Gaur made several efforts to utilize the sanctioned amount on the campus but in vain. As years passed, the interest accrued on Rs 40 lakh came to around Rs 5 lakh.

The staff may have genuine grouse, but they shouldn't inconvenience patients.\" Demands on the table The workers striking since January 31 have two primary demands: regularization of work and salary hike. \"Some of us get just Rs 4,000 a month, and have no benefits like PF and insurance. KSAPS should be merged with the health and family welfare department,\" said Asif Ali, a lab technician at Victoria Hospital ART Centre, and a member of KSAPS employees' union. Many protesting employees said they haven't got their January salary. Of the 72 sanctioned posts for doctors at KSAPS, half are vacant, said the union representatives. However, NGOs, a crucial player in the war against AIDS in the state, are divided in their opinion. Said Praja Rajakiya Vedike's Elavarthi Manohar, \"The government must protect workers' interest.\" Samuel Jesudas, a volunteer with Accept, an NGO, however felt medical services are essential and the plight of the patients can't be ignored. Usha A, who works with KNP +, a network of HIV-positive people said, \"I am bringing in new cases every day to the ART Centre but returning without any progress.\" \"Medical service is essential. The plight of HIV-positives can't be ignored,\" said Samuel Jesudas, volunteer with Accept, an NGO. Pay disparity The starting salary of a government doctor is Rs 60,000 a month. But because I am with KSAPS, I get just Rs 25,000; this is nothing but disparity. I see 200 HIV-positive patients every day. With such poor working condition is it possible to do justice to my work or to my patients? No new doctors have been recruited as most are unwilling to work with KSAPS. In Bowring Hospital itself, two post are vacant. Dr Nirmala C, medical officer, art centre, Bowring Hospital Must take medicines Two lakh people living with HIV have enrolled with ART Centres across Karnataka. Of them, a lakh take Antiretroviral Therapy treatment, a monthly administering of medicines. These are compulsory and life long drugs and have to be taken at a 12-hour gap. They can't be missed. Saroja Putran, Karnataka network of people living with HIV/AIDS (KNP +) Key point noted Their key demand, a hike in wage, has been assured by the health minister. I hope they agree and withdraw the protest. The other demands like regularization and bringing them under the 6th Pay Revision aren't under consideration.

Not only in the ICTC (Integrated Counseling and Testing Centre ART) where the patients are tested and (Anti-retroviral Therapy), the base for treatment and management of HIV infection and AIDS, all STIC/PPTCT/DAPCU/SRL/SACS and blood bank services are not available either for more than a week. There are only two ART centre's in the state capital, one at KGMU and the other at RML Hospital and both are currently closed for patients who have been recently diagnosed as HIV+. In view of the strike, patients are forced to move to private hospitals which are expensive and not equipped well enough.

The authorities were quick to label him as another victim of the multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment that \"made patients suicidal\". For his mother, though, he was a victim of the city's indifferent public health system. \"HIV/AIDS had killed my husband around 12 years ago. That was also the time when I and my son tested positive for the disease. But I never felt so defeated then as much as I feel today. I could not save my son,\" said the 37-year-old mother of two. She does not cry or show any emotions as she narrates her son's painful journey since he was diagnosed with tuberculosis in December 2012. The robust Revised National TB Control Programme was of no consequence to the lower-middle- class family that spent over Rs 4 lakh, collected by selling land and other assets, to fund his treatment in a private hospital. The teenager, by his mother's own admission, faltered on the tuberculosis treatment and developed resistance to the drugs. This January, when his condition deteriorated, the family admitted him to Sewri TB Hospital, where MDR-TB was diagnosed. \"He often complained about the medication and injections,\" said the mother. \"I had no idea about MDR-TB. Doctors don't tell you much. They should have told me the drugs can make one suicidal,\" the mother said. Early on Wednesday, the mother said, she gave him his medicines, and left the ward as hospital rules did not allow her to sleep in a male ward. He developed breathing problems around 2am and called his mother on her cell phone. She rushed to his ward immediately. \"The nurse saw me there and started screaming. She said if someone misbehaved with me in a male ward, the hospital will not be responsible. I was asked to leave immediately,\" she said, adding the scuffle happened in front of her son. In less than an hour, the teenager slit his wrist. For the next three hours, the mother waited for an ambulance to arrive so that her son could be rushed to the nearby KEM Hospital, Parel. They reached KEM Hospital only around 5.30am. \"For the next 12 hours, my son lay there waiting for a surgeon to arrive. Three doctors checked his wounds but no one actively treated him. By 6pm, his pulse became feeble. He was declared dead in the next two hours,\" said the mother. \"So did TB or HIV kill my son? My answer is no, the system did,\" she said. Medical superintendent of Sewri TB Hospital Dr Rajendra Nanavare said people who work in the hospital cannot be called apathetic. \"They work here at the risk of getting life-threatening infections. MDR-TB patients are suicidal because of medication. We keep a close vigil but one has to understand we also work under a lot of staff crunch,\" he said. Doctors at KEM Hospital's casualty said they must check their records before commenting on the case."}

The complainant subjected herself to various tests from different laboratories to ascertain whether the HIV virus had passed into her at the time of the incident,\" said the order.

They demanded that the department of AIDS control (DAC) increase VLT availability. The test is crucial to detecting the onset of AIDS. Networks affiliated to People Living with HIV (PLHIV) like the Manipur-based Community Network for Empowerment (Cone), a state-level network of people who use drugs, and Medicine Sans Frontiers (MSF) stated that the Manipur State AIDS Clinical Expert Panel (SACEP) is not doing enough to ensure availability of VLT. It also accused SACEP of falling prey to bureaucratic red tape and putting the lives of HIV positive people at risk. \"In Assam and Sikkim, samples are sent directly to the referral laboratory in Kolkata. However, HIV positive people in Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh have to come to the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences in Imphal to give their blood samples. They have to wait a long time to get their results as well,\" said Leena Menghaney, campaign coordinator, MSF. According to recent guidelines of World Health Organization (WHO), HIV positive people who are on antiretroviral treatment(ART) need to get a VLT done annually to ensure correct treatment. Menghaney added that VLT accessibility in some African countries was better than in India. Citing an example of an HIV positive Manipuri girl who lost her life while waiting for a VLT, community members of PLHIV expressed that treatment monitoring was a necessity. \"HIV positive people in the region, whose first line of treatment had failed, could die waiting for access to VLT to confirm treatment failure. We want DAC to respond to the situation here and ensure that patients do not face unnecessary delays in their clinical assessment,\" said Rakjumar Nalinkanta, president, CONE. Till July 2013, Mizoram had 8,258 HIV positive people, with 2,556 patients on ART, 12 patients on second line treatment, and 14 people waiting for VLT. Two people died last year in December while waiting for VLT. In Manipur, there are more than 40,000 HIV positive people. VLT determines the success of ART. There are VLT machines in Manipur, Assam and Megahalya but they are not recognized by NACO. Viral Load Test measures the number of copies of HIV'S genetic material (RNA) in every millilitre of blood. A person's viral load is undetectable when there are less than 50 copies per millilitre of blood, implying that the virus has been suppressed. The test prevents patients from being given more expensive drugs by doctors. However, owing to its high price of VRL, a patient's CD4 white blood cells are still used to monitor a patient's response to treatment."}

Apart from urging the government to pass the revised Manipur State AIDS Policy, 2010, in the ongoing assembly session, the memo sought to make all entitlement schemes and benefits available to PLHIVs. The memo urged the government to ensure that laboratory testing and investigations for HIV/AIDS patients be made free of cost in all government hospitals and Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres. This would include treatment for opportunistic infections and related illnesses like hepatitis C. The NGOs also demanded that basic amenities such as drinking water, sanitation and seating arrangements at all ART centres should be provided to PLHIVs. Manipur is one of India's six high HIV/AIDS prevalence states. According to the latest report prepared by Manipur State AIDS Control Society (Macs), the state has 43,707 PLHIVs. Of this number, 11,878 are women and 2,780 are children. As a result of the government's failure to implement such measures, PLHIVs face acute challenges in accessing basic healthcare, supportive medicine, food, education and housing. The memo highlighted the increasing poverty levels among Manipur's HIV positive community and stated that increasing prices was a major threat to the infected population as it decreased access to basic commodities. The NGOs demanded the appointment of adequate doctors in government hospitals to deal with HIV cases, especially gynecologists for female PLHIVs. Increasing accessibility of ART at treatment centres and installing and improving CD4 count and viral load testing machines at such centers were some of their other demands. The memo, a copy of which was forwarded to Manipur speaker Th Lokeshwar Singh, health minister Phungzathang Tonsing, social welfare minister A K Mirabai Devi and MLA I Ibohalbi Singh, stated that the NGOs had earlier put forward their demands to the government, but in vain."}

The camps were part of a pilot project of the Union government. It was to be implemented first in Kolhapur and then replicated at other places. The project, however, could be formally launched only on Wednesday. The sugarcane farmers' agitation for better prices from factories had delayed it. The Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) could, however, successfully 'cover' the 50,000 sugarcane workers. Those found to have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been counselled and administered medicines free of cost. Kolhapur district, known as the sugar bowl of India, has 22 cooperative and private sugar factories. At least two lakh sugarcane cutters from Marathwada come to these factories to work on contract basis. The factories sign them up the workers for four or five months. The workers come in October and stay till the end of the cutting season in May the next year. They operate in groups and are on the move from one farm to the other for the harvest. Some of the men take their wives along. Many of the workers go to roadside female sex workers from whom they get infected. Also, the sugarcane farms are located close to main roads and national highways. After the day's work, the workers go to highway food joints and look for sex workers. Some of them also have casual sex with women workers on sugarcane farms and the infection spreads further, said an officer on the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) project. Chief executive officer of the Kolhapur Zilla Parishad Vijay Suryavanshi on Wednesday spoke to a gathering of factory workers at Gurudutt Sugars Ltd in Kolhapur district's Shirol tehsil. A function was held there to launch the Union government initiative. The CEO told TOI, \"We have conducted a meeting with the managing directors of sugar factories in Kolhapur and have sensitized them on the importance of the programme. The identities of the HIV patients are not disclosed. They have to take the medicines that have been given to them and take some precautions so that the infection is not spread.\" The overall approach to AIDS is still not broad enough, so it would help if the check-up camps are held at the sugar factories, the CEO said. Mobile units have been used in the awareness and health check-up camps. The MSACS has also instructed the civil hospital and the district health department to participate in the drive. Three NGOs, too, are assissing the MSACS in he project. \"Sugarcane cutters were never specifically covered under the AIDS protection project. To get the exact picture of the community, we decided to extend the project to the as many sugar factories in the district as possible. We have communicated with the agriculture department, sugar factories, the civil hospital and the district health department regarding the project. It started little late because of the agitation for higher sugarcane purchase price,\" Jagdish Patil, regional programme officer of MSACS, told TOI on Wednesday. \"The biggest challenge is to conduct health check-ups of this migrant community. It is a high-risk population and we are creating information material for them. We have received lists of the number of labourers from each sugar factory; awareness programmes will be scheduled accordingly,\" said Deepa Shipurkar, programme officer, Kolhapur district AIDS control and prevention unit. In 2013, the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) had decided to focus on migrant labourers and had chosen Kolhapur for its pilot project. In its earlier intervention missions, NACO had concentrated on truck drivers in a nationwide campaign. They were identified as a vulnerable group. Labourers who migrate for work, especially in brick kilns and hotels, were also targeted in an awareness drive."}

Often referred to as a viral time bomb, the disease is widespread among intravenous drug users (IDUs). Manipur's Surachanpur and Bishnupur districts have the highest number of people carrying the Hepatitis-C virus (HCV), with prevalence rates among the districts' IDUs being nearly 90 per cent and 78 per cent respectively. In Nagaland's Wokha and Phek districts, the prevalence rate, as per an Integrated Bio Behavioural Assessment Round 2 Testing, conducted in 2009 by the Indian Council of Medical Research and others, was 20.8 per cent and 8.7 per cent respectively. Prior studies showed that in Manipur, the prevalence rate of HCV is 55 to 80 per cent among IDUs, as opposed to 22 to 33 per cent HIV prevalence among them. \"The main objective is to create awareness about viral Hepatitis in the region. The epidemic is at our doorstep, with people getting infected, testing positive and some deaths being reported. However, NGOs and the government continue to ignore the spread of the disease,\" said Ketho, general secretary of Hepatitis Coalition of Nagaland (HEPCON). With much of the focus being restricted to HIV-AIDS and cancer awareness, HCV often escapes attention. With no proper cure or vaccine, course-related HCV treatment is also considered too expensive. People with HCV are prone to develop chronicity that can lead to liver damages. Research show that close to 75 to 85 per cent HCV patients develop chronicity, as opposed to Hepatitis-B patients (HBV). \"Intravenous drug users are the most vulnerable. HCV prevalence is much higher than that of HIV. This indicates that there is a bigger pool of HCV patients among IDUs,\" said Gajendra Kumar Medhi, doctor and scientist with the Indian Council of Medical Research. Another factor responsible for the high prevalence of HCV amongst IDUs is needle-sharing. Even with efforts to promote safe injecting practices, the prevalence of needle-sharing is quite high. Users may lessen sharing of syringes, but indirect sharing is widely practiced. Nearly 50 to 70 per cent IDUs admitted to sharing accessories like common containers for drug preparation, filter cotton and rinse water."}

An erratic drug supply of second-line medication has forced thousands of patients\u2014some from as far as Nagpur, Sindhudurg, Akola and even parts of Gujarat\u2014to frequent the treatment centre multiple times a week to collect the drugs instead of the usual once-a-month practice. \u201cMost HIV-positive people hide their status at their workplace. We cannot afford to seek leave every alternate day to collect the medicines. Several people have lost their jobs because of this,\u201d said an HIV patient, adding that lately he has been asking for leave once every week. The Bhayander resident said he has already switched jobs twice as too many questions about his absenteeism were raised at the workplace. Another HIV-positive patient, a 37-year-old Sion resident, said he has been missing doses as his boss has started questioning his medical fitness. \u201cHow many leaves can an office grant in a week? We cannot even buy the drugs from outside given the steep cost,\u201d he complained. Patients are livid that while other four ART centres\u2014in Nagpur, Aurangabad, Pune and Sangli\u2014have dealt with the medicine shortage by procuring them locally, the same zeal was lacking at JJ, which has been accused of inadequate supply of drugs for the last six months. The only centre to disburse second-line medicines in city, it also caters to patients from Konkan region. An official from the state Aids control society said the hospital has recently purchased second-line medicines worth Rs16 lakh, but the patients rejected the claim. Nearly 2,400 patients are on second-line HIV treatment in the state, of which about 900 come to JJ Hospital. \u201cWe wrote to the Mumbai District Aids Control Society asking for three months\u2019 supply of drugs, but did not get any response,\u201d said Dr VK Joglekar in-charge of the ART centre, JJ Hospital. \u201cThe problem will be resolved within a month. We have placed the orders. Tenders were floated earlier but there were no bidders,\u201d said Dr BB Rewari, head of ART at National Aids Control Organisation. A member of CHIRAG, an action group of HIV+ people, alleged that at least two HIV-infected patients died last year due to the delay in moving them from first- to second- line of treatment. One was a 37-year-old woman who was admitted to JJ for three months, only to be told that her viral load was too high for the second-line medication to work. \u201cShe died within days,\u201d said a worker from the group."}

Not just ill-informed and superstitious Khap Panchayats but even our educated and intelligent health service providers have apparently added a fifth 'varna' to our patriarchal, parochial, and stratified society. At the very bottom of the heap are the new untouchables - those who are denied c-sections, gallbladder and other surgical interventions, those who can't get broken bones mended - children, women, and men testing positive for HIV. The first-ever survey conducted by HIV positive people (also called PLHA) on HIV positive people in Patna came to light recently. So much is the fear of being ostracized that 50% of those surveyed haven't disclosed their status to their family while 77% haven't disclosed their status to close friends. While 5% lost their share of property, 2% of the women were thrown out of their homes. As many as 34% of those employed face problems at the workplace after their HIV status became known. However, the majority of the survey sample consisted of those in the informal sector. The Community Health Medicinal Unit (CHMU) presented their findings on issues and problems of people with HIV and AIDS in a consultation attended by prominent members of the HIV/AIDS fraternity, including representatives from state government bodies, NGOs, doctors, lawyers and so on. The report reflected the growing anxiety of PLHA and their families about the denial of surgical procedures and treatment by government doctors, some incidents of which have been highlighted in the local media. By and large, BSACS (Bihar State AIDS Control Society) and the state government have ensured regular and timely dispensing of ART (antiretroviral therapy) medicines that PLHA need with 94% of the survey respondents giving positive responses about the facilities available in Patna (PMCH and RMRI). But no PLHA gets treatment for opportunistic infections from the PHCs (primary health centres). Greater coordination is needed between BSACS, government and civil society to address issues that go beyond the mere distribution of free medicines. \"Doctors belong to the educated and enlightened section of our society, but there are among them (those) who practice untouchability vis-\u00e0-vis persons with HIV,\" said the report. The doctors attending the event claimed there were orthopaedic surgeons and gynaecologists in the city who have never refused to operate on patients with HIV, but these can be counted on the finger of one hand, says Chandy Joseph of CHMU. The conference recognized that surgeons fear contracting HIV by coming into contact with infected body fluids during operative procedures, and government hospitals are not provided good quality protective gear. It strongly recommended that the government supply adequate protective kits to surgical departments to deal with this issue. Doctors Diwakar Tejaswi and A K Singh said the government should turn its attention to upgrading four key factors that impact PLHA and are linked to prejudice against them. These factors include doctors and training programmes, availability of post-prick prophylaxis, availability of protection kits and care and nursing services training for serving PLHA. The doctors recommended that the government should conduct trainings and orientations for medical service providers and paramedics on how to provide services to PLHA, and enlist as resource persons surgeons such as Dr John Mukhopadhyay, Dr Manoj Kumar and others who regularly perform surgical interventions for PLHA so that there could be a sharing of ideas that will lead to a reduction in stigma and discrimination. The conference also recommended that PLHA should be entitled to BPL status and accorded the entitlements by virtue of their condition in the spirit of the Supreme Court judgments. This status could be provided on the basis of the ART card. Special efforts should be made to ensure that the Right to Education Act norms of elementary education effectively covers children with HIV. The positive attitude of the representatives of the PLHA attending the conference was remarkable. \"Yes, many of us face discrimination, even abuse, but we are not here to point fingers. Let's educate each other, understand our fears, and engage with civil society and government more actively,\" said Sanjeet Singh, the person who has successfully used the PIL route to bring relief to affected members of the PLHA community."}

They appear like any other couple, yet theirs is no ordinary coupling. Having tested positive for HIV-contracted from different partners-some years ago, the 43-year-old Desmond and 38-year-old Catherine did not let AIDS tie their lives in knots. Instead, they tied the knot, and thanks to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) their child is HIV negative. For Melvin and Janet D'Souza, both also HIV positive, the tying of the knot happened 30 years ago. They chose not to have children. NGOs working towards enlightening society on the humane treatment of those with HIV say more and more people with AIDS in Goa are taking the plunge into marriage. \"Loneliness and lack of companionship often lead to neglect of one's health, so having a partner does create an environment for a better future and longer life,\" says Maria Cardoso, project officer at Udant. Anita Pereira, also with the NGO, says, \"Many who have HIV initially have doubts about getting married, but, HIV does not prevent anyone from marrying, it only requires a little more responsibility and trust from both people in the relationship.\" Medications, new infections, family issues and failing health burden HIV-positive couples everyday. Yet they stand by each other, fighting tough. Catherine, who contributes to the family income by selling vegetables she grows, says the couple has \"abundant worries\". \"We have short lives. And we have to think about the future of our child.\" Janet, who works at the insurance firm where Melvin worked, says, \"Most of the challenges we face are perceived, not real. We make choices based on these perceptions.\" Two of the choices for the D'Souzas have been not to have children-\"we didn't want to leave them orphaned\"-and not to buy a house-\"so the surviving partner would not be saddled with a mortgage\". \"I never thought long-term about changing my career. I am just happy we can support ourselves,\" says Janet. Pereira says many people with HIV nurse dreams of marriage and living normal lives, but since they are unable to meet like-minded people, their dreams remain unfulfilled. \"Moreover, having a sexual relationship with your partner can cause tremendous anxiety if you are HIV positive.\" She points out the contrast that people with other diseases and disabilities lead normal, healthy lives that include relationships and marriage. Ask Janet what advice she has for those with HIV getting into relationships, and pat comes the reply, \"I don't think my advice would be different for 'positive' or 'negative'.\" \"Honesty,\" she says, \"Is the most important thing you can bring to the table. And tolerance. And letting people grow at their own pace.\" There's also learning how to argue. \"If you're agitated, walk away, and don't come back to the subject until you've calmed down and can hear each other's point of view,\" says Janet. Melvin says it's important for couples to support each other in doing things they're passionate about. Also, \"toss aside the petty stuff and concentrate on what's important. When you are given a life sentence, you make sure every day counts\". Dipak Kabadi, director of the government-run Goa State Aids Control Society (GSACS) says, \"There are half-a-dozen NGOs working to create awareness about HIV, and helping people living with the disease not to be stigmatized.\" Cardoso sums up the message when she says, \"Supporting persons living with HIV to get married and have a family is an encouragement to help them lead a normal life.\" (Couples' names changed to protect identities)"}

A small scale baby-wellness competition was part of the drive. Another message we wanted to spread among the parents and caretakers was though some of children are HIV+, they can live a normal life.

Shockingly, the hospital that treats over 850 patients at any given point of time does not have a single full-time counsellor. On Monday, an HIV-positive woman, who was admitted to the hospital, about 10 days ago for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR) treatment allegedly jumped off the lift duct on the first floor of the hospital. Her brother and his wife had paid her a visit just a few hours before she allegedly committed suicide. The autopsy report showed that she died of head injury. On February, it was a 19-year-old boy from Bandra who slashed his wrist after he could no longer bear to go through the long-drawn treatment regime. \"MDRTB treatment lasts for up to two years during which the patient can suffer from adverse effects ranging from nausea, deafness, blindness, among other things. The patient needs to be constantly motivated to take the medicines,\" a senior public health official said. Currently, there is only one counsellor from Medicine Sans Frontiers visiting the Sewri hospital. tnn \"Counselling should be made mandatory for resistant TB cases. They suffer from extreme mood swings. Most of them endure enormous financial and personal hardships that inadvertently affect their treatment,\" said a senior doctor from the TB hospital. The TB Hospital is already reeling under vacancies. For instance, only eleven assistant medical officer posts out of 27 are filled up. The hospital is running without two of its deputy medical superintendents. A BMC official, however, said that the situation will soon change. \"Sewri TB Hospital will get four counsellors for its DOTS plus centres and so will KEM, Nair and Sion hospitals. The posts have already been sanctioned from the centre under the Revised National Tuberculosis Programme (RNTCP),\" the official said."}

Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston and the Oak Crest Institute of Science in Pasadena, California, set out to study the relationship between the skin cells and the \"good\" bacteria. The health of the human vagina depends on a symbiotic/mutually beneficial relationship with \"good\" bacteria that live on its surface feeding on products produced by vaginal skin cells. These good bacteria, in turn, create a physical and chemical barrier to bad bacteria and viruses including HIV. The researchers are the first to grow human vaginal skin cells in a dish in a manner that creates surfaces that support colonisation by the complex good and bad communities of bacteria collected from women during routine gynecological exams. The bacteria communities have never before been successfully grown outside a human. By using this model of the human vagina, researchers discovered that certain bacterial communities alter the way HIV infects and replicates. Their laboratory model will allow careful and controlled evaluation of the complex community of bacteria to ultimately identify those species that weaken the defenses against HIV. The research group led by Richard Pyles at UTMB also indicated that this model \"will provide the opportunity to study the way that these mixed species bacterial communities change the activity of vaginal applicants including over-the-counter products like douches and prescription medications and contraceptives.\" The team documented the potential for their system to better evaluate current and future antimicrobial drugs in terms of how they interact with \"good and bad\" bacteria. In their current studies a bacterial community associated with a symptomatic condition called bacterial vaginosis substantially reduced the antiviral activity of one of the leading anti-HIV medicines. Conversely, vaginal surfaces occupied by healthy bacteria and treated with the antiviral produced significantly less HIV than those vaginal surfaces without bacteria treated with the same antiviral. The study was published in the journal PLOS One."}

But then we are giving same drugs to all HIV positive patients, hers is one out of a thousand case.\" The doctor also denied that HIV patients were not operated due to stigma or fear. \"Specialized doctors are operating the HIV positive patients like others.

However, this change is so gradual that it is unlikely to have an impact on vaccine design, researchers said. \"Much research has focused on how HIV adapts to antiviral drugs \u2014 we wanted to investigate how HIV adapts to us, its human hosts, over time,\" said lead author Zabrina Brumme, an assistant professor in the Faculty of Health Sciences at Simon Fraser University. \"HIV adapts to the immune response in reproducible ways. In theory, this could be bad news for host immunity \u2014 and vaccines \u2014 if such mutations were to spread in the population,\" said Brumme. \"Just like transmitted drug resistance can compromise treatment success, transmitted immune escape mutations could erode our ability to naturally fight HIV,\" said Brumme. Researchers characterised the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sequences from patients dating from 1979, the beginning of the North American HIV epidemic, to the modern day. The team reconstructed the epidemic's ancestral HIV sequence and from there, assessed the spread of immune escape mutations in the population. \"Overall, our results show that the virus is adapting very slowly in North America. In parts of the world harder hit by HIV though, rates of adaptation could be higher,\" said Brumme. \"We already have the tools to curb HIV in the form of treatment \u2014 and we continue to advance towards a vaccine and a cure. Together, we can stop HIV/AIDS before the virus subverts host immunity through population-level adaptation,\" Brumme added. The study was published in the journal PLOS Genetics."}

The representatives made the observations on Monday at a two-day meeting here which was attended by members of the department of AIDS control and regional participants working with IDUs. The discussion focussed on strengthening support systems, capacity building, resource sharing and better coordination among regional networks to make harm-reduction services more feasible. \"We are concentrating only on IDUs. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss strategies for strengthening networks and establishing linkages. There is a need to discuss critical areas of diagnostic studies and we need to be engaged with the state AIDS control societies,\" said IHRN's Rajkumar Raju. Despite substantial work in the field of HIV/AIDS prevention in the last two decades, there was still a high probability of new and potential IDUs getting infected with HIV or Hepatitis C in the northeast, said Raju. IDUs are considered a high-risk group, along with commercial sex workers, as far as chances of contracting HIV and other blood-borne diseases were concerned. Harm-reduction services provide substitution programmes for intravenous drug users and provide them with clean syringes \"The infection spreads quickly and most infected persons have no idea that they are afflicted. It is important that we devise ways to strengthen IDU networks in the northeast,\" said Raju. The need for Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) and better OST-related services will also form part of the discussions on Tuesday. \"There should be an effort to make local groups stronger so that information about new populations of intravenous drug users is recorded. Harm-reduction programmes were started to battle HIV,\" said Aditya Singh, department of AIDS control."}

But doctors themselves have to be more cautious about contracting contagious diseases from patients they treat. Of late, both doctors and nurses in Trichy hospitals are alert to HIV risks from patients undergoing surgery. There have been cases where HIV-positive women who were admitted for delivery or caesarean didn't disclose their health condition fearing discrimination. To be on the safer side, doctors are now insisting on HIV tests for all surgery cases. Sources said two HIV-positive pregnant women got admitted at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) for emergency delivery in October and December last year. Only after completing the surgery, doctors came to know that they were HIV-infected. \"A nurse fainted after knowing that the blood scattered on her during the delivery was of an HIV-infected woman. She later took treatment to avoid the infection. Such incidences have occurred occasionally,\" said a hospital source. R Selvakumar, district supervisor, District AIDS Prevention Control Unit (DAPCU), said the HIV tests are being compulsorily done after such incidents. \"Following such incidents, HIV test was made mandatory. But we have heard that some private hospitals don't conduct the HIV test though it is a simple procedure. Doctors should take precautionary measures and HIV patients should not hide their health condition. Moreover, HIV-infected people should screen themselves at anti-retroviral therapy centres,\" said Selvakumar. Some private doctors here said patients hide information about certain health issues fearing adverse response. Dr S Nagamani, an obstetrics and gynaecologist here, said most private hospitals are strictly following all procedures before carrying out any surgery on pregnant women. \"Patients may not disclose condition fearing discrimination. But we take universal precaution to avoid any infection from any patient. The risk of infection is higher from Hepatitis B-affected patients than HIV-infected ones. Still, we do the HIV test before carrying out any treatment and safely handle the waste blood,\" said Dr Nagamani. Some doctors say that they can only advise the patients to undergo HIV test but they cannot force them. \"Yes, there is risk for doctors. But we educate them to undergo necessary tests. Our patients too agree to undergo tests. But we should not force them because they have the right to refuse to undergo tests,\" Dr A Charmila, a functionary of the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India. Dr KS Devanathan, the president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Trichy, said HIV test is mandatory for all patients. \"As patients are not willing to disclose their health problems before undergoing surgery, tests are compulsorily done at all private hospitals so that doctors can be safe,\" said Dr Devanathan."}

Observing that an \"exception\" could be made in the case, additional sessions judge Kamini Lau said, \"Poverty is a big curse for humanity and in my considered opinion these youngsters have already suffered enough on account of their continued incarceration after their arrest.\" The court said convicts Arjun (23) and Dharmender (24) were good friends and the circumstances which compelled them to plan the offence was the life threatening condition of Arjun's mother who died as she could not get proper treatment for her disease due to lack of money. \"There are strong chances of their reformation and any harsh view by this court at this stage would spoil their entire future and hence a lenient view is taken against the convicts,\" the judge said. The court also said that this was a case which should be treated as an \"exception\" and a lenient view should be taken against Arjun and Dharmender who were young and self-employed at the time of the incident and belonged to poor families. They have no previous history of crime. The court sentenced the duo to imprisonment of one year and 18 days which they have already spent behind bars. It also imposed a fine of Rs 2,500 and Rs 500 on Arjun and Dharmender, respectively. The court noted that Arjun's mother, who was now no more, was HIV positive and doctors at Bara Hindu Rao Hospital here had referred her to private hospitals where authorities refused to treat her unless the family gave money for the treatment. According to the prosecution, on December 26, 2012, Arjun and Dharmender had conspired to rob Rs 4.15 lakh from PP Jewellers, Karol Bagh. When complainant Mukesh, who was working as a field boy with PP Jewellers at Karol Bagh, reached Keshav Puram, Arjun robbed him of Rs 4.15 lakh using a pistol.

However, prior to that, the journey wasn't easy for this girl suffering from thalassemia, a condition caused by variant or missing genes that affect the production of haemoglobin in the body. She had to undergo regular blood transfusions to fight the genetic disorder. Finally, it was a website by Bangalore-based startup Jagriti Innovations that came to her rescue. The company, in association with Cure2Children Foundation, Italy, has developed a software platform for complete management of bone marrow transplant. Noor not only underwent such a transplant in Islamabad but also got financial concessions, thanks to some generous doctors in the network. The site, , provides technical support to thalassemia care, and has tied up with Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) Centers in low and middle income countries like India, Pakistan and Italy. The software enables storage and tracking of policies and procedures, apart from drugs/supplies inventory management warning of low stocks and expiry dates. \"The website helps doctors have a real-time conversation along with patient's medical records with their counterparts from other centres. There are 12,000 children born with thalassemia each year in India, and the only curative option available to them is bone marrow transplant (BMT). Our technology makes BMT safer and more affordable,\" says Rajat Kumar Agarwal, CEO, Jagriti Innovations. Recently, the startup's work was featured in the Journal of American Medical Informatics Association. However, hospitals in Bangalore are yet to tap the technology. \"Only one hospital in Bangalore deals with a large number of thalassemia patients and it's a government one. We have approached authorities and are working towards a tie-up. In the next three months, five children suffering from thalassemia from Bangalore will be taken to Jaipur for bone marrow transplant,\" adds Rajat. Since 2008, over 2,400 patients have been registered, more than 1,600 have been tested for histocompatibility, and 112 bone marrow transplantations have been performed on children with thalassemia. In Bangalore alone there are 800 kids suffering from thalassemia at any given time. In most cases, the disorder can be cured with donation of matched, healthy stem cells from the patient's sibling. \"The focus is on a medically, ethically and financially justified advanced medical procedure,\" says Dr Lawrence Faulkner, medical director of Cure2Children Foundation."}

The attacker, a 42-year-old Agripada resident (name withheld by TOI), was subdued by ward boys and relatives of other patients in the third-floor general ward and handed over to the police. Dean T P Lahane said he seemed to display symptoms of schizophrenia. He has been admitted to a ward in JJ hospital, and his arms bound, said sources. He has been charged with murder, but is yet to be arrested. Police said around 6.30am, he came out of the toilet and attacked Thakur, whose lung cancer was in an advanced stage, but who was to be discharged in three days after a month\u2019s stay in the hospital. \u201cBy the time, ward boys and patients\u2019 relatives could stop him, he had smashed Thakur\u2019s head,\u201d said a source.

Rupa lost her shelter since. She lived around the Kolhapur railway station for a few days; now she lives beside a narrow alley connecting the Central Bus Stand and Dabholkar corner. Rupa isn't alone. Following the Kolhapur police's raid 10 months back, over 150 sex workers like her have been living on the streets. Some of them are HIV-positive and many carry sexual diseases. Out on the streets, they have slipped off the radar of the district AIDS control and prevention office. Over 200 female sex workers (FSW) lived in Yadav Nagar before the 2013 raid; some of them for more than four decades. At present, not a single room is occupied. \"The colony was established some 50 years back and most of the workers were from the border areas of Karnataka. The raid of August 19, 2013 dispersed them, all of them lived as tenants. It has become difficult for us to find them and take them to health check-up facilities,\" said Deepa Shipurkar, programme officer, Kolhapur district AIDS control and prevention unit. \"I am worried about their health as well as their potential to spread the disease. We used to conduct their check-ups once every three months and used to treat them from sexually transmitted diseases. Some of them are HIV-positive and still have not attended check-ups,\" Shipurkar said. The 'missing' sex workers are a cause for worry for Varangana Sakhi Sanghtana, a community-based organization for sex workers in the city. The organization had been operating a cr\u00e8che for sex workers' children, a community kitchen and a self-help group. Everything came to a pause following the police action. \"I could reach out to only about 20-30 FSWs over the last 10 months. Nobody wants to come to us. They want shelter and we are unable to provide that. Earlier, it was easy for us to make them aware of AIDS and other diseases. But now the system has broken down,\" said Bilkesh Inamdar the project coordinator of the Maharashtra AIDS Control Society (MSACS). MSACS is following up a rehabilitation plan for these displaced sex workers with the Kolhapur district administration. It has proposed some sites where rehabilitation can be done. \"We have been meeting the administration officials for the rehabilitation plan. Once land is approved, we will have to find all the missing sex workers. They must live at one place so that they can get treatment for AIDS,\" said Jagdish Patil, programme officer of MSACS, western Maharashtra."}

He had raped his seven-year-old niece and then strangled her at Kasegaon village in Sangli in 2011. The bench comprising justices V K Tahilramani and V L Achliya observed, \"There can be no doubt that the offence committed by the accused deserves severe condemnation and it is a heinous crime, but on looking at the cumulative facts and on balancing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, we do not think that the case falls in the category of rarest of rare cases. Hence, we are not inclined to confirm the death sentence.\" On March 26, 2013, the district and sessions court at Islampur had convicted and sentenced him to death for raping and murdering the girl. The victim, a resident of Sangli, was studying in standard two in a local school. The prosecution's case is that on February 26, 2011, the man had taken the girl from school to Kalammawadi, near Kasegaon in Walva tehsil and raped her in a sugarcane field. He then strangled her and fled to Pune. When the girl did not come back from school, her mother told her husband. He inquired with the school teacher who had told him that she had gone with her maternal uncle. After a search, the girl's father registered a criminal case with the Kasegaon police station. The rapist was arrested after investigations revealed his involvement in the crime. The victim's body was recovered from the sugarcane field. The trial court had sentenced him to death under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He was sentenced to life imprisonment for rape under section 376 (2) (f) of the IPC. He was also sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment each for kidnapping and destroying evidence under sections 363 and 201 of the IPC. The trial court had sent a reference to the high court for confirming the death sentence. He had also filed a criminal appeal challenging the death sentence in the high court. Additional public prosecutor Mankuwar Deshmukh relied on aggravating circumstances to prove that the accused had brutally raped and murdered a defenceless girl. She pleaded to confirm death sentence as the girl was last seen in the company of the accused. She relied on the DNA report to prove that the blood stains found on the victim's frock matched his blood group. She submitted that the rapist was a habitual offender as he had two cases registered against him with the Chinchwad police station here in 2009 and 2011. The HC later found that he had been acquitted in both the cases. The HC appointed lawyer Abhaykumar Apte to represent the man from its legal aid committee. Apte argued that police had not recorded his statement to show that the dead body was recovered at his instance. He also challenged the identification parade of the accused on the grounds that the witnesses had seen him at the police station. The HC's observations Quoting several Supreme Court judgments, the HC bench said, \"The man was suffering from HIV and this was the only mitigating circumstance in his favour for commuting his death sentence to life imprisonment.\" The HC also sought his doctor's advice on whether his life span will be that of an ordinary man if he continued with the medicines. While partly allowing his appeal, the HC on examining the evidence maintained his conviction under sections of the IPC, but commuted the death sentence given for murder to life imprisonment. The HC also commuted the life imprisonment awarded for rape to 10 years RI. However, both the sentences will run consecutively. The sentences of three years RI each awarded for kidnapping and destruction of evidence will run concurrently. The judgment was delivered on May 8 and posted on the HC website on June 18."}

As they innocently await a new set of books and uniforms, the nuns who run the home are struggling to find a school willing to admit the children. The problem arose when the nuns approached a school close to the home and the children were refused admission as 14 of them were HIV+. Despite there being two other schools closer to the institute, the nuns then approached a school in Sulcorna, that is about 15km away. The Sulcorna school decided to admit the children, but ran into trouble when parents objected. Sources in the Sulcorna school management said parents of other students objected to HIV+ children sharing space with their children and threatened to pull out their children from the school if the HIV+ children were admitted. ?Some parents even sought school leaving certificates for their children, school sources said. Speaking to TOI, the head of the children's institute said, \"The parents believe that if their children mingle with children with HIV, they would be exposed to the infection.\" To allay such fears, Indian medical association (IMA) Goa state president Dr Jagadish Cacodkar had a session with the school's parent teachers association (PTA) to explain that \"merely mixing with HIV positive persons does not pass the infection\". Some 200 PTA members attended the session and Cacodkar claimed they appeared satisfied with the explanation and reasoning. Cacodkar said the opposition by parents was a result of misconception. \"The main reason parents object is because AIDS is incurable. The psychological fear of contracting a deadly disease coupled with misconception about its transition has compounded their ignorance. Their biggest misconception is that HIV is contagious,\" he said. \"They were explained why it is not possible to get an infection if you touch a HIV positive person, share a seat with one or even when you eat from a common plate,\" he said. Even late Friday evening, the nuns were in talks with the parents and the school management, and remained hopeful that all the children from their home will be admitted. \"I can say that 95% of the problem is sorted out. Consultative efforts to change the outlook of parents seems to be finally yielding results,\" the nun said. Until last academic year the 14 HIV positive children were schooled in the home. It was only this year that, emboldened by the Supreme Court decision in March that asked Central and state governments to end discrimination against HIV positive children during school admission, the nuns decided to admit them in a public school. While they almost succeeded, their attempt was derailed by parents. How HIV spreads The virus can be transmitted only through body fluids like blood, semen or breast milk. HIV cannot spread through saliva, sweat or by touching. The virus finds it hard to survive outside of bodily fluids You cannot catch HIV by Breathing the same air as someone who is HIV+ Hugging, kissing, or shaking hands with someone who is HIV+ Touching a toilet seat or doorknob after an HIV+ person Sharing food with an HIV+ person"}

Particularly because it was a reversal of its own conscious and bold decision taken only a few days ago to admit those students on \"humanitarian grounds\". When the Salesian priests came to Sulcorna over 50 years ago, they transformed large swathes of jungle areas into a farm, growing sugarcane, cashew, and other cash crops, employing locals as farmhands and helping the needy. Today the Don Bosco Agro-Ed Complex at Sulcorna, situated on a sprawling lush land, has grown into a hub of educational, agricultural and social activities. \"Besides playing a pioneering role in the remote villages along this hinterland belt in the field of agriculture, horticulture, watershed development etc, the activities of Don Bosco Sulcorna, have always been village-centric. We have taken utmost care of the villagers all these years and the locals hold us in high esteem. We are always the first to reach out to them in their times of need. We have always fought for protecting the interests of the villagers. We have helped them form self-help groups and cooperative societies, besides helping the young in gaining employment. Though our students come from a poor background, they excel in studies and are on par with those from the urban schools. Our relationship with the villagers is close knit and we share a mutual trust,\" sources in the school management told TOI. Sources within the local community confirmed that it was exactly because of the villagers' sense of attachment and belonging to Don Bosco school that they felt \"let down\" by the school management when it granted admission to HIV positive students residing \"far away\" from the village. The school management is now concerned about the probable withdrawal of students by their parents in case admission is granted to the HIV positive students. The HIV positive students have also been denied admission in at least two other schools located in the vicinity of the children's home in which they are lodged, it is reliably learnt. It was exactly because of such discrimination against HIV positive students that the Naz Foundation (India) Trust, an organization which runs a care home for orphaned and vulnerable children, had moved the Supreme Court, invoking the fundamental rights to life, education and equality guaranteed under the Indian Constitution. The foundation had pointed out that based on their own HIV status or that of their parents or guardians, children affected by HIV face multiple forms of discrimination in schools. It was on this PIL that on March 3, the Supreme Court issued notices to the Centre and all states to declare HIV positive children as a disadvantaged group under the Right to Education (RTE) Act to ensure they got education without discrimination. Section 9(c) of the Act says, \"Every local authority shall ensure that the child belonging to weaker section and the child belonging to disadvantaged group are not discriminated against and prevented from pursuing and completing elementary education on any grounds.\""}

Being a sensitive matter, the government doesn't want to make public the proposal for a solution fearing that it might go against the interest of the children, the sources said. A couple of meetings took place on Tuesday to resolve the issue. The government has involved bodies like Goa state aids control society to come out of the imbroglio. Confidentiality is also being maintained as parents of children studying in a Sulcorna school threatened to withdraw their wards en masse if the HIV+ children were admitted in the school. The Sulcorna school was in a fix as it had on humanitarian grounds decided to admit the children after two schools close to the children's home where they were housed, had reportedly refused to admit them. Though the education department was initially reluctant to intervene, officials went into a pro-active mode after the chief minister Manohar Parrikar, who is also the education minister, stated that the government would not tolerate any discrimination. An official said that the government will ensure that the Supreme Court directions are implemented - that there is no discrimination to HIV children in getting admission to a neighbourhood school. A source said that the education department is also working on adopting some preventive steps so that such cases do not occur in the future. In March 2014, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Centre and all states on a PIL to declare HIV-affected children as a disadvantaged group under Right to Education Act (RTE), to ensure that they get admission without any discrimination. The Goa state commission for protection of child rights as well as GSACS members have decided to meet the stakeholders.

They are only required to work 18 hours a day and keep their mouths shut when the media calls. Citizens have a tougher job, however. They will not only be required to brave all the price increases that the Modi government is dishing out but will also be subjected to a government sponsored, taxpayer-funded ad blitz that will extol the virtues of marital fidelity in an attempt to combat the dreaded AIDS disease. Health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan is an ear, nose, throat (ENT) specialist. So he sure knows how to pry out secrets of ill-health and treat patients. His diagnosis of India's battle with AIDS so far is that its citizens' moral fibre will have to strengthened if the disease has to be brought under control. In an interview to The New York Times, the health minister has said that the thrust of the AIDS campaign should not be only on the use of condoms as it sends the wrong message that \"you can have any kind of illicit sexual relationship, but as long as you're using a condom, it's fine.\" He added that the national campaign should also promote integrity of sexual relationship between husband and wife \u2014 \"a part of Indian culture.\" The emphasis on Indian culture is in keeping with the BJP's emphasis on highlighting what it calls positive aspects of Indian culture to combat lifestyle problems caused by excessive or socalled reckless adoption of western culture. READ ALSO: \u200bHealth minister questions stress on condoms in AIDS fight Right-wing Hindu organisations have been know to use force to shut down pubs and rail against 'indecent' dressing among women. This is, however, the first time since the government formation in May that a high-ranking minister has publicly endorsed cultural attributes in the fight against a major disease. Dr Harsh Vardhan, who was the BJP's chief ministerial candidate in the Delhi 2013 assembly elections, has already issued orders to the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), which is responsible for running the HIV prevention programme in the country. It has been advised to tone down the emphasis on use of condoms and instead promote morals to tackle the disease. \"For high-risk groups like sex workers and men who have sex with men, we will continue the emphasis on condoms as morals won't catch their attention,\" V K Subburaj of NACO told ET. \"However, for the general public the minister has asked to stress on morals like being faithful, not indulging in pre-marital and extra-marital sex,\" he added. \"The minister wants us to emphasise that just because condoms are available, one should not indulge in illegal sex,\" he added. This culture vs condom comment by the health minister has not gone down too well with HIV activists who believe that such statements defeat the purpose of years of efforts in tackling the disease. And it comes when the country is making headway in bringing down the number of HIV+ cases in India. Dr Harsh Vardhan remained unavailable on phone and an email sent to his official ID remained unanswered. NACO figures show that the rate of HIV in India has halved in the last decade. However, what remains a concern is the resurgence of the deadly disease in low prevalence states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Uttar Pradesh among others. They further say that half-baked information based on morality does more harm than educating people about safer sex. Anjali Gopalan of Naz foundation, an organisation that works with HIV patients, said that the idea of Abstinence, Be faithful, Use a condom (ABC) approach has been around for long, but doesn't always work. \"Just because condom is available, not everyone starts having sex,\" she said. \"Either ways you need to promote condom use.\" \"Sex happens in India irrespective of cultural taboos as we have found in our work, especially the helpline that ran for 13 years (1996-2009) and attended to over 60,000 calls,\" said Prabha Nagaraja, Executive Director, TARSHI, an organisation that works on reproductive and sexual health issues. She also pointed to a study done by the organisation, Population Council, in 2010 which showed that a large number of youth in both urban and rural India indulge in premarital sex and are often poorly educated about the risks associated with unprotected sex. \"So it is better to inform people about safe sex, including use of condoms instead of letting them rely on incomplete/misleading information,\" she added."}

Strongly objecting to the post that states: \"The Goa church loves everyone except HIV+ kids,\" Kamat demanded that a FIR be filed against Swamy for \"attempting to create and promote enmity against the Catholic Church\". He said the post is clearly an offence coming within the ambit of Sections 153 and 153-A of the IPC and as it is in cyberspace, an offence needs to be registered against the BJP leader under Section 66A of Information Technology Act. The complaint states that by accusing the church of loving everyone except HIV positive children, Swamy \"has tried to give a communal and political twist to a very sensitive issue by trying to portray the church in Goa as not being sensitive towards HIV positive orphans\". The issue pertains to admission of 13 HIV positive students from a community care centre run by Catholic nuns in Sanguem taluka. As nearby schools did not admit the students, a school in Sulcorna run by Salesian priests volunteered to admit the children but as parents of other students objected, they were not admitted. When parents objected to the children's admission in another school, this time in Rivona, the children were denied admission here too. The controversy in the last three weeks is over the admission of 23 orphans who grew up with the HIV positive students in the same community care centre. Stating that the BJP leader has made an insensitive statement without knowing facts, Kamat pointed out that the community care centre where these children are being taken care of is run by church institutions.

The experiment, carried out with six HIV-infected volunteers, is an important advance in the so-called kick-and-kill approach for a cure, they said. The technique aims to force the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) from its last redoubt after it is beaten back by antiretroviral drugs. These drugs can bring HIV in the blood to below detectable levels, enabling sick patients to return almost miraculously to normal life. But the therapy has to be taken every day, is costly and carries potential side effects. If the drugs are stopped, HIV usually rebounds within a few weeks and starts once more to infect other immune cells, exposing the body to opportunistic microbes. For the past three years, scientists have focused on ways to kick HIV out of its bolthole and then kill the hideaway cells. In a presentation at the International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark described a step forward in the first stage of this process. Six patients on antiretrovirals took an anti-cancer drug called romidepsin, which prompted virus production in HIV-infected cells to crank up to between 2.1 and 3.9 times above normal. In five patients, the level of virus in the blood increased to measurable levels, an important threshold. agencies"}

After initial clamour from AIDS activists on July 10, three portable but temporary CD4 machines were provided to Kiphire, Zunheboto and Tuensang districts. But activists say the new machines are for an interim period and meant for affected people in the interior areas only. Nagaland has only four CD4 count machines in Mokochung, Tuensang, Dimapur and Kohima that are 9 to 10 years old and were brought from other states.

Altogether, 2437 HIV positive people from Tuensang district of Nagaland are facing uncertainty about their present status of HIV drug treatment.

They should stop playing with people's lives and put their act together. It is really shocking to see that even after our repeated reminders no remedial action was taken from DAC for replacing the machines with new ones. It is now to see that the promise made by DAC, of providing 4 new machines by end of September is kept or not,\" said Ketho Angami, Coordinator, NUN."}

On World Hepatitis Day on Monday, World Health Organization called for using similar strategies and infrastructure to check the spread of infection caused by Hepatitis viruses. The issue was discussed at the first roundtable consultation on viral hepatitis organized by WHO at Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. \"The HIV/AIDS programme in India has been successful mainly because of its robust sentinel surveillance mechanism, involvement of community health workers and NGOs to spread awareness and availability of free drugs. These strategies and infrastructure can be used to spread awareness about Hepatitis B and C that follow similar modes of transmission,\" said Dr Nicole Seguy, technical advisor at the WHO country office. There are five main hepatitis viruses, of which B and C cause the most fatalities as these can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. Dr Seguy said preventive measures such as compulsory vaccination for Hepatitis B, promoting safe sex and screening of blood for infections at the time of transfusion can help check the spread of diseases. \"Though there is treatment available for Hepatitis C, few can afford it. The government should make efforts to subsidize or make drugs available for free to those infected,\" she added. Dr S K Sarin, director of ILBS, said a key recommendation made by the experts group at the WHO meet was that the government should utilize services of 17,000 HIV surveillance centres for screening Hepatitis B and C patients. \"If one person in the family has Hepatitis B, chances of others having it are high. It is important to screen them for the virus before vaccination because the vaccines can only protect uninfected patients,\" he said. Nata Menabde, WHO representative to India, also stressed on the need for reliable information on viral hepatitis for building prevention and control measures. \"WHO calls upon all partners and stakeholders to make the 'silent' epidemic of viral hepatitis more visible and more manageable,\" she said. \"We have had massive awareness campaigns for polio, HIV or tuberculosis in our country. Hepatitis is also one such disease which can be prevented to a large extent if people know about it,\" said Dr S K Acharya, HOD, gastroenterology, at AIIMS. According to him, patients get to know about the disease at a very late stage."}

While GSACS is given credit for generating awareness about the deadly disease among high-risk groups such as commercial sex workers, truck drivers, motorcycle pilots, the Sanguem incident emphasizes the GSACS' need to also focus on the general population and work towards eliminating stigma attached to HIV AIDS. Raj Vaidya who works for Positive People, a NGO working for HIV/AIDS, says besides creating awareness, more importantly, GSACS will have to now work towards doing away with stigma, and discrimination that HIV-infected people face. \"A lot of work has to be done,\" he says indicating that it will be a mammoth task. Vandana Patankar, project director, GSACS, who is well aware of the task before her, said though they have started awareness programmes and workshops are being conducted, she says it will be a while before people come to really understand the issue and bury their prejudices. She said the issue is complicated as there is no cure for HIV/AIDS. Present day parents, most of whom have one or two children, become too protective about their children even though HIV is not contagious. \"Two or three decades ago, parents rarely bothered who their children's classmates in schools were, with whom they play with. But today the scene is different,\" she says. The situation, she says is not synonymous to Goa alone. \"It is a phobia among the general population and the disease is a stumbling block,\" she says. In their revised efforts to ally fear about HIV/AIDS among the general population, she said they have started involving people at all levels. \"We are engaging panchayat representatives, health officials and other to pass on the message,\" she added. A school teacher from a Mapusa school said many teachers are themselves ignorant about the disease or at times, despite of being well aware that merely touching or sitting next to a HIV-positive person will not get them an infection, they will still refuse to mix with HIV-positive persons. \"This I have gathered from hearing teachers talk in the staffroom. What they feel about HIV-infected people. It is sad,\" she said. She feels efforts should be made on all fronts to enlighten people about HIV, so that infected people are treated with dignity. Vaidya also observed the efforts should not be half-hearted otherwise in future there will be more instances of schools closing their doors on children suffering HIV."}

The management of the centre had to battle for over a month to find a school for its 37 children, of whom 13 are HIV positive, after parents of students at two schools stiffly opposed the admissions. Parrikar said the news about the children's illness was leaked to the parents of other students of Fatima High School, Rivona. The parents then started demanding cancellation of the admission and the school was compelled to close for a few days. The problem has now been resolved with the intervention of the local MLA, officials of the directorate of education, Goa sarva shiksha abhiyan, Goa state commission for protection of child rights, health department and district administration, said Parrikar. The HIV-positive children have also been admitted to a school, he said, adding that in the interest of the children he would not mention the name of the school. He said the role of Fatima high school has also not been above board. \"The school, knowingly or unknowingly leaked information about the medical health of some students, which is against provisions of the RTE Act,\" said Parrikar.

As if the trauma of losing their parents to HIV/AIDS at a tender age was not enough, neighbours had closed their doors on these HIV-positive orphans. Facing protest and discrimination from neighbours, the girls had to vacate their special home \u2014 an apartment in Puna area of the city. This is when a city-based businessman extended a helping hand \u2014 Mahesh Savani of PP Savani Group offered his plush farmhouse to accommodate these girls. Today, these girls, whose number has grown to 49, not only enjoy their accommodation at the farmhouse but also pursue their education in a school near by. Since last one year the girls have not suffered from any infection, which was otherwise routine for them. \u201cHIV/AIDS medicines of six girls have been discontinued as their CD4 counts have improved and they are in a better condition. These girls now believe that they are not just patients but also human beings,\u201d says Savani. He has even named his farmhouse \u2018Janani Dham\u2019. CD4 cells, also known as T-helper cells, are a type of white blood cells that fight infection. At their previous shelter, these girls were banned from playing in the residential campus. Following objections, Gujarat State Network for Positive People (GSNP+), the NGO taking care of the girls, was forced to relocate the girls. But with limited budget they had no other option than to ask government for accommodation facility. After Savani offered his farmhouse, these girls have a sprawling garden and a play area equipped with a couple of rides for their recreation. \u201cLiving in a lush green area has helped create positivity among them and it has improved their health. No major infections as well as improvements in CD4 count reflect their healthy condition. They can now access good education and meet other citizens regularly,\u201d says Daksha Patel, vice-president of GSNP+. Savani is now planning to accommodate HIV+ widows at the same farmhouse. \u201cIf things move ahead as planned, we will soon support HIV+ women by offering them home at \u2018Janani Dham\u2019.

The eye-witness, whose name is being withheld on request, was the first person to respond to Lad\u2019s high-pitched scream before she fell out of the auto late on Friday. Police said the eye-witness, along with the local corporator Usha Bhoir, had rushed to her aid and drove her to the hospital. When he returned to the accident spot, three youths who were riding on a bike, came close to him and demanded to know as to why he rushed to help a stranger. \u201cThese youths appeared very irritated and instead of lauding my rescue efforts they flared up.

The boy rushes to the doctor's chamber, takes his coat and runs back. The doctor and nurse rush behind him. Back with mom, the child says he resorted to the ?theft' just to bring his mother's case to the doctor's notice. Has the message percolated down to the doctors? Apparently not. A 45-year old HIV+ woman died at the PMCH after being denied surgery to remove intestinal obstruction in September last year. Amid much hue and cry, the state health department promised a slew of reforms to ensure people with HIV were not denied healthcare for their other ailments, but they seem to have remained on paper. Even the Patna high court's prods in this regard have gone in vain. Had it not been so, 45-yr-old Ram Kumar would not have been made to run from pillar to post ? from IGIMS to NMCH to PMCH, to be precise ? to get his urethra dilated. More than ten visits to these government healthcare facilities notwithstanding, Kumar remains untreated. It was on August 4, 2009 that Kumar visited the IGIMS' urology department for the first time. Investigations were conducted on him. \"However, when it was discovered that I am HIV positive, I was told to go away. As my condition deteriorated, I visited the hospital again after four days. They again said it was not possible to operate me at the IGIMS,\" he said. As the complications increased, Kumar visited a private doctor. He prescribed treatment for a year but the surgery became a must. Kumar went to the NMCH in December 2013. He was refused surgery there too and was instead \"referred to PMCH/IGIMS.\" To try his luck for the third time, the patient went to the IGIMS again and found history repeating itself. \"The machine through which the operation is done is not functional,\" Kumar quoted the same doctor as telling him this time. In July this year, Kumar went to the PMCH which referred him to the IGIMS. \"I have lost all hopes. The private doctor says it is high time I got operated upon. If I die, who will be responsible for my death?\" Kumar asked TOI on Friday. The doctors Kumar visited have written \"HIV+\" in bold letters on the top on his prescriptions despite the fact that the treatment protocol prohibits such ?announcements'. All that the doctors can write on such prescriptions is ?PLWHA' which stands for people living with HIV/AIDS. Kumar's is not a one-off case. Raja Singh of Chhoti Pahaari at Patna has been endlessly waiting for a heart surgery. He even visited a private hospital where the doctors told him he should go to the PMCH since his was an HIV case. He has made several rounds of the PMCH's Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology since then. Intermittently, he was referred to AIIMS, Safdarjung Hospital and G B Pant Hospital (all in Delhi). Gyan Ranjan, a social activist who has been taking cudgels on behalf of the people with HIV, says he gets 30 to 40 calls from such patients every week. They are denied surgeries ranging from uterus removal to orthopaedic restoration. A patient was denied endoscopy at PMCH last year, he said. According to Ranjan, doctors at times frighten away the patients by cooking up stories. \"Two months back, a 40-yr-old woman of Chhapra went to the PMCH to get her stone problem treated. Doctors told her she would die on the operation table and she returned without treatment. Such cases are common in orthopaedic department too,\" Ranjan said. \"After the death of a woman last year, the PMCH administration promised it would allot an operation theatre for two days a week for surgery of people living with HIV. That promise has gone in vain. Doctors say they are not being provided safety kits while their hospitals deny this claim. The responsibility has not been fixed and, as such, the vicious cycle of denial goes on,\" Ranjan said. (Patients' names have been changed)"}

The test reports were OK, including the one that declared Prasad HIV negative. The patient was not told about the outcome of test reports and given an appointment for surgery. As advised, the patient also purchased certain medicines for the purpose. It was at this time that the patient asked the PMCH doctor if he could continue with his antiretroviral therapy drugs, which are meant for persons with AIDS, post the surgery. \"Once the doctor discovered I am actually HIV positive, he asked me to leave. He said it was a complicated surgery which could lead to my death My repeated pleas fell on deaf ears,\" Prasad recalled.

People should be cautious about being involved in freak road accidents than worrying about being infected by just playing or sitting with an HIV positive child,\" stated Falleiro, who is an associate professor, vice-principal and head of the department of economics, Rosary College of Commerce & Arts, Navelim. It is to be noted that many of the findings from his PhD thesis were published in internationally and nationally reputed journals. Falleiro credited the Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS) and other NGOs for doing their bit for HIV infected persons and also creating awareness in the state; which he believes has lead to a declining rate of HIV positive cases detected in recent times in Goa. He added that though they have done their bit, there is still much to be done for the infected and affected, considering the serious nature of fallouts that they have to face in their day-to-day lives. The book is an outcome of an intensive study conducted in the state and is bound to give the reader new insights of the multi-dimensional economic hardships faced by HIV/AIDS households. \"The medical expenses of HIV positives respondents (one per household) was on an average greater than the total medical expenses of all household members taken together from non-HIV/AIDS households, despite free treatment received by majority of those suffering from HIV/AIDS,\" said Falleiro. Falleiro also highlighted the plight of minors by stating that about 10% of the households withdrew their children from school, forcing them to take up odd jobs or turn care-givers to help sustain the family. \"Almost 55% of the HIV/AIDS households required care-givers and around 10% of the care-givers were minors,\" revealed Fallerio, adding that 75% of the HIV/AIDS households have made no provision for their children's future."}

Another patient said hospitals like JJ in Byculla and KEM in Parel are the only ones with some stock. \u201cThey too are giving the drugs only for a week,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no word from the authorities, including the Mumbai District Aids Control Society or Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) as to when the medicines will arrive,\u201d he added. Head of medicine at KEM Hospital Dr A R Pazare said that they had stocks, which should last for about a month or two. A senior official from MSACS said the shortage was caused by a delay in supply of the drug by one specific supplier. \u201cWe have got the stock on Friday and it has already been released to all the ART centers in the state. We have also provided MDACS with 21,000 tablets. Drugs should be available by Monday hopefully,\u201d the officer said.

Yes and no. The state recorded a marked decline in incidence of HIV infection and deaths from AIDS between 2009 and 2013 among both men and women. However, in what is both a pointer to the vulnerability of the third gender and an indictment of a failure in social inclusiveness, the mortality rate of HIV-positive transgenders in the state increased by more than 1,600% over the same period. READ ALSO: AIDS can be brought under control by 2030 \u2014 UNAIDS Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TNSACS) statistics, sourced by TOI through an RTI petition, show that 1,537 men and 814 women died of HIV/AIDS-related causes in 2009. Effective intervention by the state led to a decline in the numbers to 1,323 male and 595 female HIV/AIDS deaths in 2013, a fall of 18.42%. Tamil Nadu \u2014 one of the four worst HIV/AIDS affected states along with Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra \u2014 recorded only seven transgender deaths in 2009. The number climbed exponentially to 113 in 2013. If this does not appear to be strikingly high number, consider that the latest census statistics put the number of transgenders in the country at 4.9 lakh out of a total population in excess of 120 crore. That is 0.04% of the general population. By comparison, the HIV/AIDS mortality rate for transgenders by population in Tamil Nadu is 5.56%. Also, activists say, the actual numbers could be far higher because transgender deaths are hugely underreported. \"Social stigma prevents the reporting of transgender deaths,\" says A J Hariharan, founder of NGO Indian Community Welfare Organisation, which works for the welfare of the sex workers and transgenders. According to the TNSACS data, the number of HIV-positive cases in the state dropped from 25,572 in 2009 to 17,055 in 2013, with the number of HIV-infected males decreasing from 14,835 to 9,868 and women from 10,665 to 7,127 over the same period. The figures raise several disconcerting questions. Have Tamil Nadu's highly acclaimed efforts to stem the spread of the disease not been an unqualified success? Is social inclusiveness a myth when it comes to transgenders despite several government initiatives to bring the community into the mainstream? Tamil Nadu was the first state to create a special welfare board for transgenders and provide them land, pension and separate ration cards. The Election Commission in 2009 created a separate entry for transgenders on voter lists. But transgenders say the welfare board has ceased to function. \"It was after Tamil Nadu that other states like Maharashtra set up welfare board for transgenders. But unfortunately the board for all purposes does not exist,\" says R Jeeva, founder of NGO Transgender Rights Association and a former member of the welfare board. Other officials say lack of awareness is probably the main cause for the rise in deaths of transgenders. \"The increase in deaths of HIV-positive transgenders is a concern. It is most likely linked to unsafe sex,\" said Dr Vijaya Raman, deputy director of Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative (TAI). But transgenders say they have little choice in the matter. Latha S, a 30-year-old transgender says she's a prostitute by compulsion and not by choice. While that may be true of most women and men who sell sex for money, individuals of the third gender \u2014 stigmatised, ridiculed and shunned \u2014 have far fewer chances of opting out of the profession than others. Latha says she did not have an education and no one would give her a job. \"I have been in the profession ever since I discovered I was a transgender and joined the community,\" she says. \"Once I left home there was no one to educate me or help me get employed.\" Her job, Latha says, involves violence from drunks and rowdies. \"Customers often do not pay and policemen harass us and force us to pay a large chunk of what we earn for protection,\" she says. \"I hate being a prostitute but I don't know what else to do,\" she says. What is worst, she says, is the vulnerability that she and other transgenders face and the constant fear it engenders. Transgenders usually leave home when they are around 16 years old, says A J Hariharan, the founder secretary of Indian Community Welfare Organisation (ICWO), an NGO that works for the welfare of the homeless, sex workers and transgenders. \"They join other transgenders and are pushed into begging and prostitution,\" he says. \"Lack of basic education means they are unable to get jobs and the stigma attached to them means even manual labour is not an option.\" Hariharan says companies could, as part of their corporate social responsibility programmes, look to help transgenders. \"That would be empowering for members of the community because it would involve acceptance of the fact that transgenders are part of society and bring them into the mainstream, apart from giving them a livelihood,\" he says. But the discrimination that transgenders face leaves them with little optimism that they could win acceptance and integrate with society. \"Social acceptance? I don't know if that is possible,\" says transgender Raji Sekar, 25. \"We can't even take a house on rent because few landlords would want transgenders as tenants.\" \"I did not wish to be transgender,\" she says. \"I was born this way and that is what people should realise for society to accept us,\" she says. Her companion Ambika M, has bruises on her face and hands. She says a group of men beat her up a few days ago. \"We face intolerance all the time, so nobody cares about our safety,\" she says. \"Not a day goes by without a transgender being beaten up by customers or drunkards.\""}

Chief minister Manohar Parrikar recently assured the legislative assembly that action would be taken against the doctor, after Sanguem MLA Subhash Faldessai raised the issue in the House. Before his retirement, Prabhudessai worked for the directorate of health services and also served in the armed forces. Post retirement he runs a private practice at Colomb, Rivona. Asked if he is open to the idea of children with HIV being given admissions in regular schools, Prabhudessai said, \u201cIt is a debatable issue.\u201d He refused to elaborate, saying he did not want to answer such questions telephonically. He informed STOI that he was registered with the Maharashtra Medical Council after getting his degree, as the Goa council did not exist then, and later he did register with the Goa council. It is mandatory for every doctor to register with the state medical council or MCI if they want to practice in India. It is also compulsory for doctors to renew this registration every five years.

Researchers at the University of Washington (UW) have developed the material which is capable of carrying substantial loads of medicine, dissolving and releasing the drugs once its comes into contact with moisture. The study builds on research conducted at UW's Department of Bioengineering in 2012. Dr Kim Woodrow and her team were experimenting with electrospinning, a process where a charged fluid containing polymers and antiretroviral drugs is projected from a syringe and through an electric field. The electric field causes the jet of liquid to break into tiny fibres, each measuring anywhere between 100 to several thousand nanometres, 'Gizmag' reported. These then come to land on a collecting plate and combine to form a stretchy fabric capable of blocking sperm and, as the researchers discovered, carrying and releasing contraceptives and antivirals. Because certain elements of the material can be controlled, such as the solubility, strength and size of the fibres, the researchers said that it may prove more versatile than other anti-HIV technologies currently in development. One sample dissolved within minutes, an application that could protect against unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Another sample dissolved over several days, which could prove useful in sustained delivery of drugs, such as birth-control pills and anti-HIV medicines. The team said that the electrospun material can carry a large load of maraviroc, an antiretroviral drug used in the treatment of HIV which has minimal side effects. The research is published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy."}

It aimed at sending out a positive message about people afflicted with HIV and on the social stigma surrounding the disease. The play, loosely based on a true story, has been written by Abhijit Bhattacharjya, a noted theatre playwright who is almost synonymous with the Assamese mobile theatre circuit because of the plethora of plays that he has scripted in a career spanning over a decade. The play is an attempt to make people more sympathetic towards people suffering from AIDS. The play was staged by Rashtriya theatre, a theatre troupe from Dharapur in the city. It will continue for six days at the same venue and later travel to other places in the state. \u201cThe story revolves around a protagonist who one day discovers that he has AIDS. Even though he is battling a severe disease, he is forced to marry,\u201d said Bhattacharjya. \u201cPeople suffering from AIDS are ostracized. The protagonist in my play is a good human being. He draws a line between him and his wife so that she is not infected. But she and his family disowns him upon knowing that he has AIDS and it is only in the end that they realize he was a good man,\u201d added Bhattacharjya. The new season is expected to have subjective themes and will also include symbolism. One such play with symbolism is \u2018Ran Kukur\u2019 or \u2018The Wolf\u2019 which is an attempt to speak against a corrupt system. The concept of the Assamese mobile theatre is considered unique due to its concept. It is only here in Assam where theatre troupes tour different places across the state. For the next eight months, the mobile theatre companies will be staging different productions. With different mobile theatre companies touring the state, competition is stiff. The budget is sometimes close to Rs 1 crore. Mobile theatre is not only entertaining but an employment generating avenue as well. Hundreds of people are dependent on such companies."}

Officials said if a pregnant woman is tested positive, efforts are made to reduce chances of transmission of HIV to her child by giving Navirapine Prophylaxis.

The couple's sorry plight came to light on Monday, when Naik and his wife, of Bhairagada village located about 70 km from the district headquarters town of Rayagada under Muniguda block, met collector Sashi Bhushan Padhi at his grievance cell and told him about their experience. The couple were diagnosed HIV positive in 2012 when their blood samples were examined during the woman's pregnancy. \"On the advice of doctors, we immediately started taking medicines and my wife delivered a son at Koraput hospital.

The battered couple went to police, who helped them return to their home. There is now a police picket in the locality in Ghola. But the stigma of social ostracism in an area barely 30km from the city centre is a grim pointer to the taboo that still surrounds the disease. Fortunately, some neighbours have come forward to support them. The couple has a six-year-old daughter, who is not HIV-positive. They were making preparations to secure her life when their own blood relatives and one-time friends turned on them. The husband, a small-time trader, is 35 years old and his wife 32. She was the first to be detected with HIV during a routine test during her pregnancy in 2006. Her husband was also asked to undergo the test and he, too, tested positive. After the initial shock, they took it bravely and went through the entire process of medication and counseling. They decided to keep their condition under the wraps when doctors told them that they could lead a normal life under medication and care. \u201cThe doctor who is treating us advised us of the precautions to take to prevent transmission. We have a daughter who is not infected. We have to take precautions to prevent the disease from spreading to her. The doctor also told us to start saving for antiretroviral therapy,\u201d the wife told TOI. A few days ago, her husband\u2019s younger brother stumbled upon their secret. He lives in the same house with his wife and two children. As soon as he came to know that his brother and sister-in-law were HIV-positive, he made life miserable for them. According to the couple, he kept demanding that they leave the house because they were putting him and his family at risk. \u201cNo amount of reasoning would convince him that we were taking all the necessary precautions since we also have a child. He and his wife would abuse and even physically assault us. Finally, on Saturday afternoon, my brother-in-law summoned a few locals who are known to him. After my husband returned from work, they caught hold of him and threw him out of the house. When I rushed to his rescue, one of them hit me on the head with a stick and I started bleeding,\u201d she added. Outnumbered and getting no assistance from locals, the couple and their daughter went to the police and narrated their trauma. Officers immediately sent a team to escort them back to the locality. \u201cThe couple says they are HIV-positive and that they were beaten up by the husband\u2019s brother. We have taken down their complaint. We will take strong action against the accused,\u201d said Barrackpore detective chief C Sudhakar. When a police contingent accompanied the couple back to their house, the accused were nowhere to be found. After ensuring that the couple was safely in their house, police left a stern message with locals not to bother them in the future. Police are looking for the man\u2019s brother and his associates involved in the attack. Sources say he has fled the area with his family."}

Following nevarapine oral suspension, a preventive medicine against transmission from HIV positive mother to a new born, which is out of stock, pregnant mothers are a worried lot. The medicine is not available either in the market or government run Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) medicine. The situation started in March at Tarn Taran when a baby could not be saved from being HIV due to the absence of another medicine, Zidovudine. This medicine is given after 40 days dosage of nevarapine in new born. \"And the same conditions continues to prevail,\" said Tarseem Singh, president of Umeed , an NGO in Amritsar that has been working for the cause. The NGO has written several letters to the officials at the Punjab state Aids Control Society, but in vain. On the non availability of the preventive medicines for HIV transmission in the new born, assistant project director, Punjab AIDS Control Society, Manpreet Chatwal, said, \"The medicine is not 100% preventive. There can be children who can turn positive from the infected mothers even after they are on these drugs. However, you come across such instances, please inform us. we will try and reach out to provide required medical aid.\" The apathy of the government towards the positives does not end here. The labour rooms in the government hospital in Amritsar has expired medicines stock, which have no potency to save the transmission. \"A couple of days ago, a baby girl contracted the virus, soon after her delivery, from her mother. The baby was given a medicine which was three days short of expiry. These preventive medicines which have expired are still kept in the labour room of Guru Nanak Dev government hospital, Amritsar,\" said Tarseem. To make the matters worse, Dry Blood Spot (DBS) analysis, a test which can detect the HIV status in the new born is also not available anywhere in Punjab. Accordingly the doctors start the new born HIV on ART drugs. \"Though the actual status of the new born is known after he or she is 18 months, delay in ART medicines after the DBS test can further enhance the virus,\" said a paediatrician in PGI."}

The prevalence of the virus among sex workers in brothels is higher than street-based and home-based sex workers, according to an RSCACS report. Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society's (RSACS) state report released recently shows that one out of 71 street-based sex workers and one out of 208 home-based sex workers are living with HIV. \"HIV prevalence varied depending upon type of sex work. Higher prevalence of 3.25% has been found among brothel-based sex workers followed by 1.4% among street-based and 0.48% in home-based sex workers,\" according to the report. The report elaborates that HIV prevalence varies among female sex workers (FSW) on the time they had spent in the work. \"Considering the duration of sex work, highest positivity has been recorded among those who are in the profession of sex work for around 3 to 5 years. During the HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) 2008, the highest positivity of 6.25% was seen among new entrants (i.e. six months to one year of sex work). In HSS 2010-11, among new entrants, the HIV prevalence is only 1.67% which is reduced by 5.58% as compared to HSS 2008,\" the report says. The HIV positivity among sex workers with one to six years in the profession is 1.67%, among those with one to 3 years is 0.38%, those with 3-5 years have highest prevalence of 2.39% and with more than 5 years in profession, such workers have 1.36% of prevalence. RSACS officials claimed that the HIV prevalence among sex workers have declined over the past few years. \"Result of the HSS 2010-11 shows that the overall HIV prevalence amongst female sex workers is 1.28%, a significant decrease of 2.53% from 2008. Three consistent sites Ajmer, Alwar and Banswara showed significant decrease in prevalence,\" the report says. The result of HSS 2010-11 shows that highest HIV prevalence rates among FSWs have been recorded in eastern and southern parts of the state. \"Nearly one out of 20 female sex workers are living with HIV in Alwar, while Udaipur and Ajmer have almost one out 100 sex workers with HIV, Ganganagar has one out of 200 sex workers with HIV,\" the report says. Alwar has higher prevalence as the work is brothel based. An RSACS official said the prevalence among the sex workers is on the decline because they are more aware of precautions and also the officials are conducting individual tracking to prevent HIV infections among FSWs. While comparing prevalence between rural and urban areas, it has been found in HSS 2010 data that prevalence rate is higher in rural areas (1.95%) as compared to urban areas (0.57%). \"A scrutiny of higher vulnerability to HIV rendering to the characteristics of the population marks that women who have certain education are more informed, and thus better able to protect themselves from HIV. This was observed in HSS 2010 data where educated female sex workers comprised a lower proportion (1.01%) of the total number of HIV positive than their illiterate counterparts,\" the report says. Moreover, the positivity is on the decline among young female sex workers aged 20-29 years. It was 4.24% in 2008 compared to 1.78% in 2010-2011, a decline of 2.46%."}

Although the NPPA\u2019s sudden notification does not mention whether it is revoking the price caps which it had announced on 50 anti-diabetic and cardiac drugs in July, the development could have negative fallout, sources said.

The NPPA\u2019s decision to impose price controls had been hotly contested; with the industry up in arms against what it said was \u201carbitrary implementation of the policy\u201d. In effect, NPPA has withdrawn guidelines for price control issued under Para 19 of the Drug Prices Control Order (DPCO) 2013, which authorized it to control prices of drugs that are not under the NLEM (National List of Essential Medicines) under \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d and in \u201cpublic interest\u201d. In July the NPPA, in a rare invocation of the lesser-used provision, had fixed prices of 50 anti-diabetic and cardiovascular medicines. This was the first time the government had brought drugs, outside the national list of essential medicines, under price control. (Prices of 652 drugs under NLEM were fixed by the government last year under DPCO 2013). The move had triggered of a series of protests and lawsuits from the industry against the drug pricing regulator as they feared more such action. \u201cIn compliance with the directions received from the government in the department of pharmaceuticals ... The aforesaid internal guidelines issued by the NPPA on May 29, 2014 under Paragraph 19 of DPCO 2013 are hereby withdrawn with immediate effect,\u201d NPPA said in its latest notification posted on its website. The industry welcomed the move saying that the interpretation of the May guidelines was erroneous. \u201cWe have always contended that the guidelines for Para 19 were erroneous. Para 19 is not the right provision for extension of price control as there is no public health concern which could have prompted the NPPA to invoke the provision,\u201d D G Shah, secretary general of Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, said. Though it is still trying to figure out its implication on companies, the industry body representing multinational firms, the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India, said: \u201cWe appreciate the government\u2019s decision to withdraw the guidelines on fixation/revision of prices of scheduled and non-scheduled formulations under Para 19 of the DPCO 2013. This welcome move tells us we are being heard and we look forward to working with the government toward a common goal.\u201d The industry expects that the NPPA will take a decision on whether to revoke the price reduction order, over the next few days. The next hearing of the OPPI court case against NPPA is slated for September 29."}

These HIV positive children are under the North 24-Parganas Network for People living with HIV/AIDS, Barasat (NNP+), who facilitates their health check-ups, treatment and other support. Majority of these children got infected from their parents while few are thalassemic and got the virus during blood transfusions. Most are orphans as their parents have succumbed to AIDS. \u201cThere are about 400 children under NNP+, many of whom have lost their parents to AIDS. Their families do not want to keep them due to the stigma. And so far there is no shelter home for these children from the government. But this effort by the staff and students of the nursing college is a reason to cheer for these children,\u201d said Samir Biswas of NNP + Barasat. The \u2018joy of giving\u2019 campaign also provided the nursing students with an opportunity to interact with HIV positive individuals. Principal Dr Subrata Sarkar hugged the children, shook hands and mixed with them, sending a message to students that HIV positive individuals are not to be shunned. \u201cThere is still so much of stigma attached with HIV positives. Such interaction, apart from giving the HIV positive kids a little bit of joy during the festival, is also a platform where we make an effort to change the attitude of the future nurses about these patients,\u201d said Sarkar.

Awarding the meagre compensation, the Madras high court on Thursday asked parents of the boy, now 16, to file a separate suit if they wanted a higher amount. S Sorna, a daily wager, had moved the Madras high court HC, seeking a compensation of Rs 10 lakh. She said doctors at the Institute of Child Health in Egmore transmitted HIV-infected blood to her son Kumar (name changed) in February 1999 after a surgery. The one-year-old boy had been was admitted to the hospital for treatment of diarrhoea. The boy was treated as an inpatient till March 1999 and then discharged. However, he started falling ill frequently in September 1999 and developed cold and swelling on his neck. Medical tests revealed that he was HIV-positive. The parents themselves underwent a series of tests, and it was found that they were not infected. Sorna then realized that the government hospital had transfused blood without a prior test. She demanded Rs 10 lakh as compensation for her son's present condition and future treatment. The hospital, however, denied the allegations saying while the surgery and blood transfusion was done in February, the boy fell ill and tested positive for HIV only in September 1999. Infection might have happened at any other hospital where the boy was treated during this period, it said. Rejecting the contention, Justice S Vaidyanathan said the parents were poor and that they could not afford to take treatment in private hospitals. By invoking public law remedy, he awarded Rs 50,000 as compensation and added that the child or his parents could invoke their private law remedy by filing a suit for tortuous damages. \"Since the hospital is disputing the case of the petitioner, contending that there is no negligence on its part, this court is of the view that the petitioner can work out her remedy by way of a suit before an appropriate civil court,\" he said. Taking note of the present health condition of the boy, \"which is deteriorating day by day\", the judge directed the authorities to take necessary steps and provide better treatment to him free of cost and extend all relief packages provided by the state government for victims of AIDS."}

Last year, 532 cases of HIV were registered in the state compared to 959 cases in 2009. A similar trend has been observed among AIDS patients with only 51 cases registered in 2013 compared to 184 cases registered in 2009. A total of 1,040 persons have succumbed to the deadly virus since 1989, when HIV was first detected in Goa. But, this is only the reported figure, while the actual number would be higher as HIV-related deaths at home or private hospitals are not reflected in the above figures. GSACS project director Dr Vandana Patankar said that they have increased the number of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres in Goa. Earlier, there was only one main ART centre at the Goa medical college, Bambolim; but, in recent years, GSACS has set up link ART centres at Asilo hospital, Mapusa, Hospicio hospital, Margao, sub-district hospital, Ponda and cottage hospital, Chicalim. Patankar revealed plans of upgrading the link ART centre at the Hospicio, Margao, to facility-integrated ART centre. This means that there will be a doctor and nurse at the centre and patients from South Goa need not travel to GMC for the initial CD4 test. He also mentioned of another link ART centre that has been approved for the Curchorem community health centre. GSACS has tied up with nine NGOs to execute 16 projects in Goa to combat HIV/AIDS. These NGOs work with high risk groups like commercial sex workers, drug users, gay men, truckers, etc. GSACS is now adding two more projects with the focus on migrants. Another new measure is towards HIV positive pregnant women. Earlier, these women were treated only at the time of delivery. Now, such cases will be provided life-long ART treatment and the child will be given treatment for at least six months depending on whether it is HIV positive or negative. \u201cPresently, the mother to child HIV transmission percentage is about 2.5%. We want to make it zero,\u201d Patankar said. He also informed of another new initiative of setting up a new opiad substitution therapy centre at Hospicio, Margao. This centre is meant to wean drug addicts who use injections from syringes to oral drugs which are less addictive. Presently, there is only one such centre at Calangute which is run by an NGO. GSACS is also adding one more ICTC (integrated counselling and testing centres) at Ponda. It already has 14 such centres all over Goa including three especially for expectant mothers. The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has sanctioned 7.55 crore for GSACS to conduct its programmes this year, but the amount is yet to be released, Patankar added."}

A genetic analysis of thousands of individual viruses has confirmed beyond reasonable doubt that HIV first emerged in Kinshasa, the capital of the Belgian Congo, in about 1920 from where it spread thanks to the colonial railway network to other parts of central Africa. Scientists have nailed the origin of the Aids pandemic to a colonial-era city \u2014 then called Leopoldville which was then the biggest urban centre in Central Africa including a market in wild \u201cbush meat\u201d captured from the nearby forests. A \u201cperfect storm\u201d of factors then led to the virus\u2019 spread in the human population. UNAIDS estimates that 35 million people were living with HIV in the world at the end of 2013. Scientists from University of Oxford said, \u201cThirty years after the discovery of HIV-1, the early transmission, dissemination and establishment of the virus in human populations remain unclear. Using statistical approaches applied to HIV-1 sequence data from central Africa, we show that from the 1920s Kinshasa (in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo) was the focus of early transmission and the source of pre-1960 pandemic viruses elsewhere. Location and dating estimates were validated using the earliest HIV-1 archival sample, also from Kinshasa. Our results reconstruct the early dynamics of HIV-1 and emphasize the role of social changes and transport networks in the establishment of this virus in human populations.\u201d Vendors sell their products beside a railroad track in Kinshasa, Zaire (File photo via Getty Images) The breakthrough was possible due to a new, sophisticated analysis of hundreds of genetic sequences of HIV from different time points and locations. The researchers also note that 13 documented cases exist of different simian viruses jumping from chimpanzees, gorillas and monkeys into humans, but only one \u2014 known has HIV-1 group M \u2014 sparked a global epidemic. They show that group M and another strain, group O, expanded at the same rate until about 1960, but then group M nearly tripled its rate of spread. Possible reasons include public health campaigns that had contaminated needles and an increase in the number of clients of sex workers. \u201cFor the first time we have analysed all the available evidence using the latest phylogeographic techniques, which enable us to statistically estimate where a virus comes from,\u201d said Professor Oliver Pybus of Oxford University. \u201cThis means we can say with a high degree of certainty where and when the HIV pandemic originated.\u201d \u201cKinshasa at that time was growing fast, it was the biggest city in central Africa at that time and was very well connected to the rest of the Congo,\u201d said Nuno Faria of Oxford. \u201cData from colonial archives tells us that by the end of the 1940s over one million people were travelling through Kinshasa on the railways each year. Our genetic data tells us that HIV very quickly spread across Congo, a country the size of Western Europe,\u201d Dr Faria said. \u201cOur research suggests that following the original animal-to-human transmission of the virus, probably through the hunting or handling of bush meat, there was only a small window during the Belgian colonial era for this particular strain of HIV to emerge and spread into a pandemic,\u201d Professor Pybus said. \u201cBy the 1960s, transport systems such as the railways that enabled the virus to spread vast distances were less active, but by that time the seeds of the pandemic were already sown across Africa and beyond,\u201d he said."}

The slack supply could lead to there being no stocks left which could make HIV positive people very vulnerable to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drug resistance as well, according to activists working with HIV positive people. The region has the highest number of HIV positive people and intravenous drug users in the country. According to the department of AIDS control (2013-2014) and as per NACO HIV estimates, the total number of new infected adults was 6,460 and there were 3,594 AIDS related deaths in the northeast region. Organizations working with HIV positive people said that depleting stocks in medicines such as Nevirapine, combined dosages of Tenofovor and Lamivudine, and Abacavir have rendered a section of the adult HIV positive people in some places to use medicines meant for children who are HIV positive. In Manipur, which is considered to have the highest number of HIV positive people in the country (40,855 in March 2012), Nevirapine is almost out of stock, sources said. A 200 mg dose of Nevirapine is taken twice a day by a HIV positive person. With diminishing stocks, patients were reported to be taking Nevirapine 50 mg four times in the morning and four times in the evening. \u201cWe cannot live without these drugs. The situation has been going on for a while. We are dependent on these medicines and a timely duration during the present course of the drug regimen keeps our health in check. Authorities should take necessary steps,\u201d said Rajkumar Kanta, president of Community Network for Empowerment (CONE). Besides the shortage, slow dispatch in medicines on the part of courier services has also caused problems. An emergency dispatch of Nevirapine for Manipur took 28 days to reach the destination. The dispatch was lying idle for 19 days in Guwahati, sources said. \u201cI took a tracking slip from one courier company for tracking Nevirapine. It revealed that from Hyderabad to Guwahati, it took 28 days. It also showed that the stocks were lying idle in Guwahati for 19 days. This is ridiculous and totally unacceptable. Among the numerous bottlenecks, this courier service is one major hurdle,\u201d said Loon Gangte of International Treatment Preparedness and Coalition. In Dimapur district of Nagaland, the Nevirapine paediatric drug is out of stock at ART centres. The same drug is available in Mokokching district but its availability could diminish in two to three weeks. In Mizoram, Nevarapine syrup, which is given to newborns, was also reported to be out of stock.

In a status report on children impacted by HIV/AIDS, Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights has questioned the complex eligibility criteria for the scheme launched in fiscal 2012-13. A 2012 study by Delhi State AIDS Control Society estimates the number of orphans and vulnerable children in Delhi as 1,908, of whom 766 were infected with HIV/AIDS. Additionally, there were 1,142 children whose parents were infected with the virus. The data used in the DCPCR study was gathered during the period April 2010-March 2012 from nine antiretroviral treatment centres, Children Affected by AIDS (CABA) pilot scheme and two institutions providing residential care to CABA in Delhi. The DCPCR study finds the coverage of the Financial Assistance Scheme for People Living with HIV/AIDS ((PLHA) of Delhi Government wanting in many ways. The scheme has so far enrolled 1,726 infected adults and children,14 orphan children who lost their parents to HIV/AIDS, 26 orphaned HIV-positive children and 12 HIV-positive destitute children. A sum of Rs 1,000 is given as monthly benefit to PLHAs including infected children, Rs 1,750 to orphaned children who are not positive but affected by HIV/AIDS as their parents were infected with the virus and Rs 2,050 to orphans and destitute children infected by HIV/AIDS under the scheme. However, the DCPCR study says there is need to reach out to more children. It is stated that the eligibility criteria are too complex for an affected person to fulfill. According to these, a PLHA has to be on one year of Anti Retroviral Treatment and has to provide proof of the same. Besides being a resident of Delhi for three years, the beneficiary must have an annual family income of less than Rs 1 lakh. In case of orphaned children there has to be proof of death of one or both parents due to HIV/AIDS. In case of a destitute child, proof of HIV positive status is mandatory. The child must also be found living in an institution in Delhi. DCPCR strongly feels these need to be reviewed. \u201cOften lack of papers like death certificate or proof of residence can hinder access to these schemes. If the process is simplified, more would be able to get its benefit,\u201d DCPCR chairperson Arun Mathur said."}

This is the first published report of a group using CRISPR/Cas technology to efficiently and precisely edit clinically relevant genes out of cells collected directly from people, in this case human blood-forming stem cells and T-cells, researchers said. The work was led by Chad Cowan and Derrick Rossi, associate professors in Harvard's Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology (HSCRB). HIV specifically targets T cells, a principal portion of the blood-based immune system, and enters via a gene receptor called CCR5 that serves as a doorway into the cells. Once inside the T cells, HIV replicates and kills off the host cells, leaving patients at the mercy of a variety of opportunistic infections. Using the CRISPR/Cas gene-editing technology, the researchers knocked the CCR5 receptor out of blood stem cells that they showed could give rise to differentiated blood cells that did not have CCR5. In theory, such gene-edited stem cells could be introduced into HIV patients via bone marrow transplantation, the procedure used to transplant blood stem cells into leukemia patients, to give rise to HIV-resistant immune systems. \"We showed that you can knock out CCR5 very efficaciously, we showed that the cells are still functional, and we did very, very deep sequencing analysis to show that there were no unwanted mutations, so it appears to be safe,\" Cowan said. Though the researchers believe that this new approach to HIV therapy might be ready for human safety trials in less than five years, they urge caution. The work could run into unexpected complications and the history of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is littered with \"cures\" that turned out not to be, researchers said. Even if this new approach works perfectly, it will require additional developments to be applicable in the areas of the world that have been the hardest hit by the epidemic, they said."}

Assisted by the Changsha Food and Drugs Supervision Bureau, the police arrested the owner of the company. This is alarming because medical experts and non-government organizations working in the field of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases repeatedly warn that fake and poor quality condoms play a key role in their spread. Such disease has been rising sharply because of the increase in migrant labor numbering about 300 million, most of whom live away from families. Experts also say that extramarital and premier-marital sex is the biggest contributing factor while causes like blood transfusion has low impact. The size of the seizure may be much larger because the police are investigating two other condom making units run by the same businessman, surnamed Chen. Working together, 200 policemen busted the five story house and seized 28 million semi-manufactured condoms and six million manufactured condoms. The seized products, packing materials and machines all together were valued at $35 million. The arrested factory owner was working on a false registration, which showed the company was involved in the production, assemblage and sales of electronic toys. The company used vibrators, inflatable dolls and other types of sex toys as a cover for its unlawful business because it had no license for condom manufacturing. Condom making is a highly controlled industry because low quality material can result in unwanted pregnancies and sexual disease including AIDS. But sex toy industry is a widely prevalent in China, which is the world's exporter of it. The illegally made condoms was made under established brand names including foreign ones to enhance their sales appeal. These condoms were sold to all regions in China except for Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, according to China.com. China made condoms including fake ones have become popular in neighboring countries as well. A report from Kathmandu said the local police raided and recovered China made condoms and sex toys worth $50,000 from a shop, which was selling under false license."}

The girl's family is now spending sleepless nights, worried if the virus has been transmitted to the girl as well. The incident took place in Andheri on November 2, when the child was sent to the house of the 45-year-old accused to collect rent. The man, a distant uncle of the child, has known the family for over 15 years and has been living in the same neighbourhood; he had recently rented one of the rooms owned by the survivor's family. As she entered the room around 11am, the accused locked the door and allegedly attacked the girl. But the child fought back, screaming loudly, which apparently angered the accused. \"Enraged, he bit her when she tried to get away from him,\" the child's aunt said. \"She still managed to free herself from his clutches and ran back home in tears and told us about her ordeal. She had bruises that were clearly visible.\" The family turned even more distraught after the child's mother pointed out that the accused was HIV positive and his first wife had died of HIV-TB. \"A chill ran down my spine. We rushed to the DN Nagar police station where we were told to visit RN Cooper Hospital in Vile Parle without delay,\" said the aunt, adding they went there, racing against time. \"We worried that even a single minute wasted would take her close to the infection,\" she said, adding Cooper doctors gave the child the first dose of anti-retroviral at 2.30pm and the medicine was continued for three days. \"Luckily, the treatment was started immediately,\" the girl's father said. Cooper Hospital doctors first performed the mandatory baseline HIV rapid test to check for infection. The girl's father said his wife and he could barely breathe till the report came negative. \"This report is of little consequence though. We have been told the virus has a window period of three months to manifest itself. We never thought we would ever cross paths with HIV,\" said the father, an auto driver. A senior Cooper Hospital doctor told TOI the child was immediately started on a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment for three days. \"We have referred the child to Sion Hospital that has a full-fledged peadiatric HIV care facility,\" the doctor said. At Sion, she will be put on a 28-day PEP regime. \"The wound can be classified as mild to moderate.\" Head of paediatrics at Sion Hospital Dr Mamata Manglani said chances of transmission in such cases are usually negligible. \"But a lot depends on the wound, its depth and if there was any fluid exchange such as blood,\" she said. Manglani added a PCR test could be carried out after a month to check the status, but an ELISA test after three months is mostly considered conclusive. The accused has been sent to the DN Nagar police's custody. The police have also approached the KEM Hospital forensic department to examine the bite marks. The child started going to school from Monday."}

One of the most commonly prescribed antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection, Ritonavir, has undesirable side effects and important oral-delivery problems. Its physicochemical properties challenge its administration to infants, said Federico Harte, associate professor of food science at Pennsylvania State University. \"Ritonavir has a high hydrophobicity and low solubility in water, which lead to a low dissolution rate in the gastrointestinal fluid and, hence, to insufficient bioavailability. \"The liquid formulation used to treat infants over one month of age contains 43 per cent ethanol and has an awful flavour that has been described as bitter-metallic, medicinal, astringent, sour and burning,\" Harte said. \"Moreover, when coming into contact with the stomach mucosa, Ritonavir causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Therefore, we need to develop alternative paediatric formulations of Ritonavir and overcome its poor water solubility to improve its oral administration to infants and children,\" added Harte. To solve that problem, Harte looked to a group of proteins in cow's milk celled caseins. Casein proteins form spherical aggregates called casein micelles, which are responsible, incidentally, for the white colour of milk. The casein micelles in mammals' milk are natural delivery systems for amino acids and calcium from mother to young, and might deliver Ritonavir molecules as well, Harte said. \"I have been working with bovine casein micelles for a few years now, and we have investigated the structure and functionality of these proteins,\" he said. \"What we found is these micelles are able to carry molecules that have very little solubility in water, that have low molecular weight and that are very hydrophobic - such as Ritonavir,\" said Harte. Harte discovered that subjecting milk to ultrahigh-pressure homogenisation enhances the binding properties of the casein micelles. Milk was homogenised at between 400 and 500 megapascals, disassociating the casein micelles and improving the protein's binding qualities to attach to drug molecules. An estimated 3.4 million children are living with HIV/AIDS, according to the World Health Organisation. Nine out of 10 of them live in resource-limited countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where effective antiretroviral treatments still are not widely accessible or available, researchers said. The research was published in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Research."}

NHS England said the \u201csignificant patient recall\u201d has resulted from concerns over a dentist who treated patients in the Nottingham area. The dentist Desmond D'Mello used to work for the Daybrook Dental Surgery. The recall was sparked by concerns that D'Mello, who treated patients over a 32-year period, did not follow proper procedures. NHS England said that since June 2014, it has been working with Public Health England to investigate apparent breaches of infection control procedures by a single dentist, who was contracted to provide NHS dental services at the former Daybrook Dental Practice in Nottinghamshire. It said, \u201cOur investigation demonstrates that acceptable infection control standards do not appear to have been followed by Mr Desmond D\u2019Mello whilst he was treating patients at the former Daybrook Dental Practice. Immediate actions were taken to protect current patients once these apparent lapses were identified. However, this alleged drop in clinical standards may have put people at a low risk of blood born viruses like Hepatitis B, C and HIV. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, we are advising all patients who have seen Mr D\u2019Mello to seek further advice on what action they may need to take\u201d. The investigation team has also consulted with clinical experts in Public Health England, who undertook a clinical analysis of the potential risk to patients. Mr D\u2019Mello has recently been tested by our Occupational Health Team and found to be clear of blood borne viruses. NHS said, \u201cBased on this clinical advice, Public Health England has recommended screening for all patients who have been treated by Mr D\u2019Mello. It is understood the number of patients affected who have been seen and treated by Mr D\u2019Mello during his time at the former Daybrook Dental Practice is about 22,000, as he had worked at the practice for over 32 years\u201d."}

In simpler words, it regulates the speed of the speech heard. So, a person with hearing disability or seeking to learn pronunciation can slow down the speech to grasp the details. Chandra Shekar, who developed VOW along with Sunil R and Aditya Vasisht, told TOI that the technology has a wide range of applications. \u201cIt can help children and people with speaking disabilities properly articulate and pick up the correct pronunciation for a word. The technique also gives the elderly and the hearing-impaired a choice to \u2018slow down\u2019 a normal talk, and perceive the details,\u201d he told TOI. At the base of the application is how humans speak and sing with the help of vocal apparatus \u2014 comprising mainly the lungs, glottis, vocal folds, vocal tract, oral, and nasal cavities. Every word we speak starts off as a train of puffs of air released by lungs. These packets of air, on their way up, hit the voice box, and make it to vibrate about a few hundred times per second. The vibrations produce a feeble sound, which is strengthened by the throat, nose, and mouth. Easy connect VOW\u2019s output quality is superior to other techniques and it\u2019s language is independent, so it\u2019s easy to integrate it into most standard media players such as Windows Media Player and Quick Time Player; voice over internet applications (VoIP) such as Skype, VQube and Google Talk; text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) applications such as iPhone Siri, and tablet-based dictation tools. Hassle-free dubbing This technology can be used in dubbing too. Artistes go for several takes to get the lip movement and the voice in sync. The task of getting the lip sync is tiresome and time consuming at times. This technology can do away with re-takes. A mathematical model that\u2019s been developed allows technicians to get the right lip sync with one voice recording. Quote We plan to develop VOW apps for smartphones so that it becomes more accessible to a wider section of people. We will also try to customize our technology to specific applications. \u2014 Prof Chandra Shekar Seelamantula | Faculty DEE & Head of Spectrum Lab, IISc"}

Instead, with one patch applied on their skin every week, such patients will be able to fight the dreadful disease! A researcher at the Department of Pharmacy of M S University's Faculty of Technology and Engineering is developing formulations for transdermal delivery of an anti-HIV drug known as Lopinavir. The research project, which started in 2010 with Rs 10.5 lakh fund allotted by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), is aimed at developing formulations which can deliver the anti-HIV drug through skin. At present, the anti-HIV drug formulations are in the oral tablet form. The research is aimed at making the drug more effective. \"Consumed in the oral form - tablets - the drug goes to liver and then to blood, where it acts against the virus. However, almost 80 per cent of this drug gets destroyed in liver by the enzymes and only 20 per cent of it reaches the blood and other organs of the body where it is actually needed,\" Dr Hetal Thakkar, who in course of the project has studied the transdermal drug delivery projects undertaken by the United States and United Kingdom-based reputed laboratories, told TOI. \"If the drug can be delivered through skin, then it will directly reach the blood without encountering the liver and hence is saved from destruction. But skin is a tough protective barrier and hence delivery of drugs through skin is difficult,\" said Thakkar, adding that to overcome this limitation, the drug was entrapped in nanocarriers which can easily permeate through skin. \"We have conducted studies on animals and we have got some promising results. When we compared the formulations developed by us with the oral formulations on rats, we found that there is nearly three times higher blood concentration which means we can also reduce the dosage of anti-HIV drug. Now, we will apply for clinical trials,\" said Thakkar. According to Thakkar, reduction in dosage of the drug will also help reduce the side effects of the drug like nausea, vomiting and gastrointestinal disturbances which HIV/AIDS patients complain about during treatment. \"If the side-effects can be reduced, the overall quality of life of the patients will improve and help in building of a healthy society. Also, the treatment will be more economical,\" she said."}

It is as big as a cricket ball. Just throw it at any place and start the video surveillance,\" said a Chinese Military officer told TOI. The unit comes with a hand-held device and two eye balls. The electronic display of the hand-held unit can show images relayed by both the eye balls at the same time. The equipment can also help launch simultaneous searches in two different areas.\" Terrorist activities are taking over traditional wars. Most terror threats are urban centric. There is a need for compact surveillance systems like this ball to counter new-age security threats,\" said an Indian army official, adding that Indian scientists too are working on equipment targeted at urban warfare. Surveillance drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are part of the experiments, the official added. \"The eye ball gives the exact picture of happenings in troubled areas, thus helping reduce collateral damage and civilian casualties. Contingency plans can be drafted properly and implemented effectively,\" said the official. A Chinese official said the eye ball is made of thick rubber among other materials. It has one high-resolution video camera, which can be operated using a remote. The ball can start sharing video footage as soon as it is thrown at the targeted area. The ball can rotate 360 degrees which helps it gather detailed information. The range of the camera is 200 meters, which with obstacles, could get reduced to 50 meters. \"The Chinese security agencies have tried and tested this technology.

Interestingly, most of these are coastal Andhra districts, including Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West Godavari, Prakasam, Krishna, apart from Anantapur in Rayalaseema. Three high priority Telangana districts include Warangal, Hyderabad and Karimnagar. \"The prevalence of HIV is more in coastal districts due to various activities that entail migration and support a floating population,\" said T Kailashditya. Coming to HIV statistics in Vizag, at present there are around 26,000 registered HIV-positive people, of which 11,000 patients are under anti-retroviral treatment (ART) while the remaining 15,000 don\u2019t require ART drugs yet as their CD4 count (a kind of white blood cell that indicates immunity level) is more than 350. Included in the 11,000 are also around 350 HIV positive children below 15 years who have been put under ART drugs, averred Dr Ramesh."}

A quick shave could be a close shave. Hundreds of roadside barbers in the city use just one razor or blade for shaving several customers. This means that with just a nick by an infected razor/blade, a customer can contract fatal infections like AIDS and Hepatitis B and C. Shockingly, there is no system or organization in the state or even across the country to check this unsafe practice. There are no checks on the barbers working at various public places, especially at railway stations, bus stands and government hospitals. Hundreds of customers unknowingly expose themselves to danger when they go to such barbers. Straight razors with open steel blades, also commonly known as cut-throats, were the most These roadside barbers can be seen at every nook and corner of the town using either straight razors with open steel blades, commonly known as cut-throats or disposable razors. They perform multiple shaves within a few minutes and do not bother to change the blade. What is more shocking is that even the persons who get themselves shaved do not ask for a new blade or a fresh razor. \u201cI shave at least 20 people every day. My customers are generally passengers who do not halt in the city but have come for a meeting or an exam. They freshen-up at public toilets at the station, get a shave here and go off to work,\u201d said Sanju, a barber at Agra Fort Railway Station. This barber was ferrying his equipment in a box and had placed his makeshift salon on his bicycle. Needless to say, there is no scope, even for sterilizing the equipment or razors. The barber when asked about his knowledge on HIV and AIDS, he said, \u201cYe sab to galat kaam karne se hota hai, dadhi banwane se nahi. Or Itna sochenge to khayenge kya (These things happen because of wrong acts and not because of shaving. If we will think that much, what will we eat).\u201d He further asserted that he charges only Rs 3 from a shave. If he increases the rates, people will not come to him. Similarly, a barber working outside SN Medical College was seen using the same old blade to shave patients\u2019 relatives. What are the precautions he takes? His refrain is, \u201cI clean the razor with warm water before using it on other customer. We also sharpen the razor on stones whereby it gets cleaned automatically,\u201d said Daddu, standing by his small salon on pavement. He also cited his meager income for not changing blades for each customer. According to doctors, this unsafe practice by barbers is simply not on the same page as the HIV and AIDS control department. No educational sessions or workshops have ever been conducted for the barbers, who are barely aware of the damger of using the same blade on multiple customers. \u201cPrevention is the only viable way to control HIV spread, as there is no cure for the infection presently. The risk of infection spreading is low with razors, maybe two in 1,000 but nevertheless, it is advisable that only one with disposable blades should be used,\u201d said Dr CP Singh, expert from the medicine department of SN Medical College. He added that the general perception is that HIV is transmitted through unsafe sex, infected blood transfusions and mother-to-child. These are the second and third highest reasons for HIV infections. But HIV infections can also be passed through sharing of non-sterile sharp instruments such as those used by barbers, incision, tattooing, ear perforation, blood-letting, injections and acupuncture. These too have always been classified as \u201cother\u201d reasons for spreading the infection and therefore given less attention in the campaign against the spread of HIV. \u201cThough barbers do not carry out procedures that deliberately penetrate the skin but sometimes just a single mick or cut caused by the clipper or razor blade is enough for an infection to occur,\u201d added Dr Singh. The doctors when asked how safe is to clean or wash the blade before using, he informed that due to the lipid envelope that protects HIV from dehydration, the virus can survive on the surfaces of barbering instruments for a period long enough for transmission to occur, particularly in commercial barber shops. Talking to TOI, chief medical officer HS Danu said there are no measures or laws to stop this roadside barbering practice all across UP. This is an ethical responsibility of the district administration and civic body to issue no licenses to these roadside barbers. \u201cBut these days, they do not even halt at roadside. They ferry their salon on bycycles and its impossible to check such practices,\u201d added the CMO."}

However, a brief chat with her changes your opinion by 360 degrees. She has no problem in giving out names, even though her brother is HIV positive, and says that it is time people were informed about HIV/AIDS and ways to deal with it. \u201cPeople know only two things about AIDS: it\u2019s incurable and the patient will die soon. This has to change,\u201d she says. Manpreet\u2019s brother was found to be HIV positive on November 2, a day which changed her life forever. \u201cSince the day he has been told about his condition, my brother has simply given up on life. He is not willing to make an effort to get better. Let alone medicines, he isn\u2019t willing to eat. But I have decided that I will fight for and with him,\u201d says she. She adds that more than the reasons which lead to AIDS, it is important to explore the approach one should adopt while dealing with a patient. \u201cMy brother never told me how he got infected. Maybe because I am his younger sister. Frankly, I am least interested in knowing that. Making an issue out of the reasons that lead to this infection is like running after the mosquitoes which bit you.\u201d On Sunday, Manpreet sent her 47-year-old brother back to the rehabilitation centre. He has been addicted to painkillers since past 15 years. He had come to live with his family in Dehradun after working in various cities and when in October his health started decorating, he was taken to the hospital. \u201cAt the ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centre, we were informed that his was a very serious case and that the therapy should be started immediately. However, I wasn\u2019t told how to take care of him at home. I called up the toll free number (18001801200) mentioned outside the centre and asked them each and everything,\u201d says Manpreet, who is in touch with many foreign organizations that work for AIDS patients. Her brother, who was initially not willing to come out and talk to the correspondent, later, changed his mind. He said he worked at a Gurudwara in Gorakhpur and due to the hectic work schedule, he turned to addictive drugs. \u201cI had to wake up at around 3 am to open the Guru Granth Sahib and had to be present at the temple till 12 or 1 pm. It was very hectic and I was not getting any rest. So I started having painkillers to help myself cope with the job. I use to take more than 20 tablets a day. The medicines are not sold without a doctor\u2019s prescription so I had bribed a doctor.\u201d Manpreet was pleased to know that her brother wanted to get rid of his addiction. He even agreed to join a rehabilitation center. \u201cBut ever since he came to know that he was HIV positive, he decided that he won\u2019t go anywhere and will die,\u201d she says. Statistics available with the state health department indicate that above 90% of the affected people in Uttarakhand were those who had earlier migrated to other cities in search of jobs. According to government records, a total of 3,500 HIV positive people in the state are presently registered at various ART centres and a total of 1,810 are taking free treatment. Close to 40 NGOs are currently working in the field of HIV/AIDS in the hill state."}

But, I started falling ill frequently after that,\u201d says Gyan. Probably, he contracted AIDS there, but he was unaware of it. In the meantime, he donated blood for a friend. After 15 days, he got a letter saying he should contact an ART centre. \u201cI did not know what it was. When I went there, the banners talking about AIDS made me realize the impending disaster in my life,\u201d Gyan says.

On World AIDS Day, we look at some of the most devoted ones: Alicia Keys Alicia Keys founded an organisation that funds anti-retroviral therapy for AIDS victims and also supports orphanages for HIV positive children.

It also promises relief to patients from severe side effects caused by drugs prescribed under ART. HIV-AIDS patients would be put on fixed dose therapy (FDT) in which a single pill would be given in place of three drugs that cause side effects and will reduce pressure on kidney and liver. Speaking with TOI ahead of the world HIV AIDS Awareness Day, Indian Society of Haemetology and Blood Transfusion president A K Tripathi said, \u201cFDT will soon be introduced across all ART centers across UP. In King George's Medical University it will be launched in mid-December.\u201d The single pill, often referred to as the wonder drug in AIDS treatment, comprises three medicines given as first line of treatment. Also, salts used in them are better than the previous formula. One of these three (stavudine) was known to cause lipid abnormalities and neuropathy. As a result, fat deposits occur in the patient\u2019s body in specific places while it dries up in other (lipodystrophy) leading to severe disfigurement. Blood cholestrol levels also go up posing risk to heart health and causing burning sensation in hands and feet. Stavudine has been replaced with tenofovir. The other salt called nevirapine had three major side effects, including damage to liver, severe allergic reaction and interference in treatment of tuberculosis. This salt has been replaced with effavirenz. The third medicine called lamivudine has been retained as it is. A policy decision to this effect was taken in May 2013 and was implemented later. It is now being launched in UP. \u201cSide effects tend to compel patients to skip medicines, which compromises the adherence rate. Success of the aids control programme cannot be guaranteed unless adherence rate is above 90% which the wonder drug helps achieve,\u201d explained Dr Tripathi. Besides introducing this drug, National Aids Control Organisation has introduced changes in the treatment guidelines which promise better success of the programme. One of them, which relates to pregnant women, says they should all be tested for HIV AIDS and if found positive, should be put on ART irrespective or the CD4 count reading. It may be noted that CD4 count is the parameter for putting a patient on ART. Till 2013 a CD4 count of 250 made an HIV-positive person eligible for ART. After a revised order, a CD4 count of 350 meant clearance for ART. The new guidelines also overlook CD4 count for HIV positive persons diagnosed of TB."}

India has managed to bring down new HIV cases over the past five to six years by bringing in more patients under treatment and promoting use of condoms, mainly among the vulnerable population such as sex workers, drug addicts and transgenders. However, inconsistency in supplies and frequent stock outs of lifesaving HIV medicines in government owned centres in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai and the northeast have the potential to put India back in the danger zone, experts warn. \u201cOnce a patient starts the therapy, medicine needs to be taken daily with proper adherence, or else the drugs quickly lose their effectiveness. Once this happens, HIV patients have to switch to a second line of treatment which is five times more expensive than first-line drugs, adding an additional burden on our healthcare system,\u201d said Daisy David, advocacy officer, World Vision India. Moreover, there is also a severe dearth of testing kits like CD4 and viral load, which are crucial for patients to monitor the virus and ascertain the stage of infection. \u201cThese tests are important because they help a doctor ascertain when to change the line of treatment for particular patients. In the absence of these tests, a patient may develop resistance to a certain medicine or line of treatment and hence develop the virus again,\u201d said Vikas Ahuja, president of Delhi Network of Positive People, a trust that works with HIV/AIDS patients. A World Health Organisation (WHO) report last year said the Indian government was providing free anti-retroviral drugs for treating HIV since 2004, but only 50% of those eligible were getting it in 2012. According to Anand Grover, founder-president of Lawyers Collective, a faulty procurement policy, withdrawal of global funding from India and other middle income countries and discrimination with the vulnerable population including sex workers and drug addicts were major causes leading to such problems. The health ministry recently told Lok Sabha that though there were shortages, it had resolved the issue for the time being by procurement and donations from a domestic pharmaceutical company. The ministry has also initiated a computerized supply chain management system for assessment of drug requirement and their stocks. The latest data from National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) shows there are over 2.09 million HIV patients in India, with the north, south and northeast regions accounting for the majority of patients. The government receives nearly $80 million from the Global Fund, an international aid organisation for HIV prevention and treatment. The United Nations estimates India currently has the third largest population of people living with HIV in the world. However, NACO data shows a significant decline in prevalence of HIV among adults across the country. At national level, prevalence was estimated at 0.41% in 2001, whereas it dropped to 0.35% in 2006 and 0.27% in 2011, latest data with the department showed. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia, said stigma, discrimination and restrictive laws continued to be barriers to accessing prevention, care and treatment services. \u201cThe HIV epidemic in our region is concentrated among populations most vulnerable to HIV: men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who inject drugs, sex workers, people in prisons and other closed settings. Although we have been successful in scaling up the health sector response for the vulnerable populations, more needs to be done. Less than 50% of these people know their HIV status,\u201d she said. Though the government is hopeful the HIV and AIDS bill, drafted in 2006, which was tabled in the Rajya Sabha in February and is currently being considered by a parliamentary standing committee, will address most of these issues, Grover said even the draft bill keeps people with HIV and AIDS out of the purview of free medicines. \u201cJust by ignoring the issue, the government cannot tackle the real menace of the disease. It needs to guarantee access to medicines for all,\u201d Grover said."}

A cause for alarm is that though the number of HIV infections has decreased this year as compared to the last, the number of HIV patients has increased. From January to October this year, Goa registered 128 cases of non-Goans among the total 376 cases registered across the state. During the corresponding period of last year, the figure was 86 of the total 386 cases registered by October 2013. Though the disease surfaced in Goa in 1987 when a foreigner was detected HIV positive with the second case being of a non-Goan in 1988, Goa has so-far registered 15,603 HIV positive persons. While Goa has registered 1,662 full-blown AIDS cases up to October, a total of 1,041 patients have lost their lives to AIDS by September this year, states data prepared by the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS). According to data gathered by GSACS, HIV infection is now prevalent in all parts of Goa. What is worrying is that in Goa, HIV is not confined to coastal belts, but has penetrated to other areas, too. The disease is no longer an urban phenomenon, but has spread to rural areas as well. The HIV prevalence is shifting its base from one taluka to other, every year. In 2013, the majority of the cases was reported in the four coastal talukas: Salcete (18.4%), Mormugao (12.8%) in south Goa district and Tiswadi (11.5%) and Bardez (14.9%) in north Goa district during 2013. But, by October 2014, Tiswadi in the north showed a marginal decrease with 5.3% prevalence, while Bardez in the same district has shown a rise of about 2.7% (16.2% in 2014). In South Goa, Salcete has shown a decline of 4.3%. The taluka has noted 14.1% prevalence as against 18.4% of last year and Mormugao a decline of 2.7%. Last year, HIV prevalence in this taluka was 12.8% which has decreased to 10.1% this year, GSACS statistic stated. Dr Vandana Patankar, project director, GSACS, claimed that a large floating population in Goa has contributed to the bulging figure of HIV-infected in the state. People migrating to Goa from other Indian states raises the figure. The state has noted a spread of the disease largely by the sexual mode. While the state has a thriving drug trade on its coastal belts, there were very less number of people found affected with passing on the needles used for injecting narcotic drugs, she admitted. \u201cBesides, most of the people from other Indian states come to Goa to get their blood sample checked as Goa has better facilities than other states,\u201d Patankar said. She also said that Goa has proper counseling, awareness-raising measures, accurate testing facilities across the state and anti-retroviral treatment (ART) center at Goa medical college and hospital, Bambolim. There are 3,476 people including 1,962 males, 1,327 females, 183 children below the age of 14 years and four transgenders have registered for the ART, statistics point out."}

However, a study conducted by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), an international NGO, says many a kala-azar patient are HIV positive, but are ignorant about it. Non-treatment of HIV weakens their immunity system, due to which even VL drugs do not show proper effect and are leading to relapse of VL. Incidentally, Bihar accounts for over 90% kala-azar (VL) cases in the world. The study published in an issue of an international journal, Clinical Infectious Diseases, says out of over 2,000 kala-azar patients screened in Hajipur, 117 were HIV positive. Only 68 of them had prior knowledge of it. The prevalence of VL-HIV was much higher in males (71.4%) than females (28.6%). It may be mentioned here that another study published in August 2014 in Public Library of Science (PLOS) had said that estimated chances of VL relapse in HIV positive people was over 25% after three years of treatment of kala-azar. The mortality rate of VL-HIV cases are also high. Even after four years of treatment of VL, 30% HIV-VL patients could not survive. There are also a couple of studies to suggest that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV positive had bettered the results of VL treatment too. These figures should be alarming because, according to an estimate, over 3 lakh people have HIV/AIDS in Bihar. The PLOS study says that the risk of developing VL in HIV positive people is 100-2300 times higher compared to non-HIV people. It added, \u201cScreening for VL in HIV cases living in VL-endemic areas must also be encouraged.\u201d Experts say HIV test must become a part of protocol to treat VL. National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) had been assigned the task of developing guidelines to this effect in the road map released to eliminate VL by the then Union health minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan. While the state government still awaits any such guidelines, state programme officer M P Sharma said, \u201cAs of now, there is no plan to include HIV testing in the VL treatment protocol. At present, we are concentrating on the guidelines given by the Centre.\u201d There is another issue of dosage of drugs. Recently, AmBisome (single dose treatment for VL) was launched in the state. However, experts say single dosage does not work well in HIV-VL patients. Dr Gaurab Mitra, who was one of the researchers of the study and works with MSF, told TOI, \u201cInstead of giving it in one dose, we divide it into six doses. We believe and recommend the same in government protocol too.\u201d His argument also finds support in the study mentioned in PLOS. The study, in fact, suggested that the number of follow-ups be more for HIV-VL cases than the VL ones."}

The percentage of people within the country suffering from the disease, however, is 0.78%. In the decade between 2001 and 2011, there was a reduction of 57% in HIV prevalence in the country which is looked upon as a big success by the global community, said deputy director general of National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) Dr Sunil Khaparde. He was in the city to deliver Dr DG Gan oration during the annual conference of Indian Academy of Paediatics, Nagpur on \u2018elimination of parent to child transmission of HIV and syphilis\u2019. In accordance with the goals of United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS or UNAIDS, India is also aiming for \u2018Zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination, zero AIDS-related deaths\u2019. Dr Khaparde is optimistic about these goals being achieved in the years to come. \u201cInitially, parent to child transmission (PPTC) was the cause of 27% of new HIV cases, which was brought down to 7% through various targeted interventions. At present, this rate is 1%. Every year, there is a cohort population of 29 million women we wish would undergo testing for HIV and syphilis. Unfortunately, due to healthcare not being accessible to all, not even half of this population is covered,\u201d he said. The problems in the way of universal HIV testing of pregnant women include the infrastructure and staff being unavailable at levels below the district. \u201cWe are trying to tackle this problem by training nurses, non-medical staff and, if possible, even accredited social health activists (ASHA), in villages to test and counsel all pregnant women. Efforts are also being made to scale up programmes and infrastructure at community health centres and primary health centres with the aim of reaching all possible pregnant mothers in time,\u201d said Dr Khaparde. As most other health issues, better treatment of HIV also requires contribution of the society. \u201cWe see that even today, there is many stigmas attached to the infection, from the general community and sometimes even healthcare professionals, that several patients hesitate to ask for help. On the level of governance, we have done much awareness generation,\u201d he said. Dr Khaparde adds that the ministry of health and family welfare has even enlisted the help of other relevant ministries like education, social welfare, industry, etc to spread awareness about HIV-AIDS."}

Tri-Dot test is done and the man is declared HIV positive. On being informed about his HIV status, the shocked man goes into a state of acute depression and even attempts suicide. Concerned over his condition, his family took him to a psychiatrist. On the advice of the shrink, his family then took him to a government ICTC (Integrated counselling and testing centre) for a HIV re-testing. This time, much to the relief of everyone, the man is found HIV negative. But it was only after enduring the trauma for a month. District medical and health officials said despite the government mandate of conducing three tests for confirming HIV positive cases, most private centres conduct a single test, which can be misleading as it is done without pre- and post-test counselling. \u201cThere have also been cases where people committed suicide or were taken ill after being declared HIV positive. Thanks to the single test carried out in most private centres for HIV testing, which often leads to wrong diagnosis,\u201d stated Dr Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy). \u201cTo confirm whether a person is HIV positive, a series of three blood tests need to be done in half-an-hour, including Coombs, SD bioline and Sigma tests. There are also other types of test kits such as Quickcheck, Elisa, Western Blot Tests as prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). However, most private centres furnish reports after conducting a single test (Tri Dot test), which is not foolproof and people end up being declared HIV positive when they are not. Such wrong diagnosis can lead to disastrous consequences,\u201d said Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao, who specialises in HIV/AIDS. \u201cMoreover,patients are also not given pre-test and post-test counselling, which is an integral part of HIV testing. Triple drug ART regime is also skipped in some private centres and a single drug regime is given. Also, the private centres charge Rs 500 for this single test, which is done free-of-cost at the ICTCs and charge Rs 6000 for the ART drugs per month, which again is supplied to patients free of cost by the government. Monthly, on an average, around 10,000 HIV testing is done in government centres in the district besides the tests undertaken by private centres, which goes unrecorded,\u201d said Dr Ramesh. \u201cAnother challenge in the treatment of HIV/AIDS is that patients turn up at the last moment when they have no option but to be administered ART (anti-retroviral drugs).

The Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) is taking measures to increase the number of tests for HIV among pregnant women. There are 20% home births where they don\u2019t lend an ear to the need of getting tested for HIV. According to health department officials, the institutional deliveries have increased significantly up to 80% but still 20% remain home-based deliveries. An RSACS official said, \u201cIn institutional deliveries, the chances of HIV transmission from mother to child reduces to 2-3% if universal precaution of delivery and proper medicines to prevent the transmission of HIV are taken. Also, such mothers should not breastfeed their babies.\u201d There are 18 lakh pregnancies reported every year in the state. In 2013-14, RSACS tested 4.68 lakh pregnant women for HIV with their consent. Among them, 412 were tested positive for HIV and there was a risk of transmission from mother to child. In 2012-13, the RSACS had tested 3.86 lakh pregnant women and found 383 of them living with HIV. Three years have passed but a 25-year-old Usha\u2019s (name changed) tears still trickle down when she remembers the moment her newly born baby was declared tested positive for HIV. She was a resident of Jharkhand before she was married to a resident of the city. \u201cI came to know that I am HIV positive at the time of my son\u2019s birth. He was born in a government hospital in Jaipur three years ago. When doctors tested him for HIV, they informed me that he is born with HIV infection. Now, like me, he is also taking medicines for the infection,\u201d said Usha on the eve of World AIDS Day. She added that she could not even breastfed her baby like other mothers as doctors had asked her not to do so. Usha\u2019s case highlights vertical transmission of HIV from mother to baby at a time when there are medicines available which could reduce the risk of transmission of HIV from mother to baby during child birth. Besides, Sunita (name changed), a 35-year-old woman living with HIV also narrated the same story. She said that her first child, a girl is HIV positive and she came to know that her husband and she \u2013 both were HIV positive during their first child birth. \u201cMy five-year-old daughter is HIV positive like my husband and me. But, I am happy for my son as he does not have this disease.

A recent report revealed that as many as 2,436 persons, including some children, have died due to HIV in the district since 2007. The report was prepared by the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit and included the figures till October end for the current year. Of the total deaths, 60% were men and 36% are women. Deepa Shipurkar, programme officer of DAPCU, said, \u201cIn some cases, the HIV positive men do not even disclose their infection to their wives. There have been cases in which the family found out about the infection when the health condition of the patient turned critical. Such tendency jeopardizes the health and future of the entire family. It is also an important season behind high mortality due to HIV infection.\u201d Kolhapur was among the six high HIV prevalence districts in the state. The high prevalence can be attributed to the presence of a large number of migrant labourers. Unprotected sexual activity and in some cases, having sex with multiple partners are two major reasons behind transmission of the infection, health officials said. Jagdish Patil, regional programme officer of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit, said, \u201cKolhapur district has 3-4 major industrial areas along with textile business of Ichalkaranji. These industrial enterprises are major job creators and people from at least 100-km periphery migrate to Kolhapur in search of jobs. A significant number of labourers are HIV positive.\u201d Another category, which is unique to Kolhapur district, is the seasonal migration of sugarcane cutters from Marathwada, north Maharashtra and Karnataka between October and April. The National AIDS Control Organization had conducted a pilot project in Kolhapur district in 2013-14 to find out prevalence of sexually-transmitted diseases among the sugarcane cutters. At least one lakh people migrate to Kolhapur during the sugarcane cutting season, and most of them are men who travel in groups. The report has already pointed out that unconventional working hours, heavy load and liquor consumption activities among the sugarcane cutters make them vulnerable. Patil pointed out that during their pilot project the people living with HIV admitted that they were involved in unprotected sexual activity. These activities are still prevalent and highly challenging to keep a control over. Kimaya Shah, managing trustee of city-based Lotus Foundation, is involved in conducting various awareness, support and medication activities in the district. \u201cThere is still stigma associated with the infection. It restricts acceptance of the disease due to which many people neglect regular medication and fail to keep the infection under control.\u201d"}

Anti-HIV crusaders fear that substandard quality of free condoms alone can push up HIV prevalence. Over the last few months, cash-strapped NGOs and community-based organisations (CBO) have raised the issue of inferior quality condoms with government agencies. A Malad-based CBO has often written to National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), that inferior quality of condoms has rendered its distribution among transgenders useless. \u201cOur workers are ridiculed for distributing condoms, which lack proper lubrication,\u201d said Gauri Sawant of the CBO. Quality assumes importance in Mumbai which has nearly 2.50lakh people in the high-risk zone and vulnerable to contract the infection. \u201cCondom distribution is key to curbing infection among men having sex with men and female sex workers,\u201d said Ashok Row Kavi founder of Humsafar Trust. \u201cSuper-lubricated condoms are not that useful.

While NGOs are supposed to get 80% of condom supply from NACO, they are expected to forge ties with manufacturers to arrange for the remaining 20%. NGOs say due to payment issues they hardly manage to get private firms interested in supplying them. For NGOs working with female sex workers, it becomes a dual challenge. \u201cIt takes a lot of persuasion for a sex worker to convince a client to use a condom. The least NACO can ensure is to provide good quality condoms,\u201d said a CBO working with female sex workers. NACO refused knowledge of quality concerns. \u201cThere have been problems with supply, which will be streamlined soon.

At 12 years, his curiosity and keenness to spend most of the time with his father led him to join this campaign. Jagjit Singh Mann, father of Tej, has been working on this social issue of discrimination against AIDS patients for the past eight years. \"When I used to leave my house for the AIDS awareness campaigns, Tej would ask me what I was doing outside, how we are working in the field to make people aware, and now he is here. He helps me in the field. Some of the causes and the sources of HIV AIDS, I really wanted him to know practically, for instance using repetitive syringes in the case of taking drugs, a menace in Punjab. Our main motive is to remove discrimination against these patients from society,\" he said. Mann is a government teacher at the Government Primary School (Girls), Mallha, near Jagraon. After his duty hours, and by taking leave, he works for this social cause. All the literature on AIDS has been taken from the godowns of the Punjab State AIDS Control Society (PSACS), where they were lying as if they were of no use. \"After many arguments with people at the PSACS centre, we brought this literature in gunny bags from there. Otherwise, they would have been sold to ragpickers. We wanted to take this to the people for whom it was made,\" he said. This year, Mann's NGO - Punjab Networking of Positive People Society - had started a campaign on World AIDS Day by travelling door-to-door to distribute pamphlets and talking to people about their HIV tests and sources of HIV, before taking them to ART centres. He started this campaign on Sunday, and will be continuing it for one week by moving around in his car and motorcycle decorated with AIDS posters. When he started this awareness programme, he had 10-12 members with him, but now feels proud that his son has also started showing curiosity about it. The campaign is going on in Ludhiana and SBS Nagar. \"I was talking to my colleague once, who was a bit worried about his friend in Rampur - a truck driver - suffering from HIV. The driver came to know about having AIDS in the last stage, as he had never heard about the disease. This left me shocked, and I decided to move ahead to spread awareness among youth and common people living away from the health systems in the state\", Jagjit Singh Mann, founder of NGO, Punjab Networking of Positive People Society. \"I am proud that my father is doing this. I joined him out of curiosity, and to spend more time with him. This awareness will be helpful to society where knowledge about AIDS is still very less,\" said Tej Pratap Singh, 12-year-old son of Jagjit Singh."}

Not a single community health centre (CHC) or primary health centre (PHC) in the district has AIDS/HIV testing facility or an integrated counselling and testing centre (ICTC). Lack of ICTCs is one of the biggest reasons why a majority of HIV patients still go undetected, especially the rural areas. There are a total of 16 CHCs in Agra district and 29 PHCs in the rural areas. Only the CHCs have a counsellors but do not have testing or diagnostic facilities. As a result, people have to come to Agra for treatment. The city has just two places where the facilities are available. Talking to TOI, a health department official said, \u201cIf you check the data of HIV and AIDS patients in the city, you will find that a majority of them hail from rural blocks. They usually come to know that they are HIV+ or suffering AIDS by accident. Those who have minimum awareness about the disease come for treatment while hundreds of others die without knowing what they were suffering from every year. The only reason is that HIV and AIDS counselling and testing is out of their reach.\u201d He pointed out that in Etawah district a large number of HIV and AIDS cases were detected over the past two years because several ICTCs have been opened in rural blocks.

However, the move has been stuck in limbo till date reportedly because the transport corporation is yet to come to an agreement with the health department over the costs involved. More than 6,000 patients all over Uttarakhand will benefit if the move is implemented. Patients and their immediate families have to travel to Haldwani or Dehradun \u2013 the only places where anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for treating the disease is conducted. The long commutes are taxing for the infirm. Expressing concern, state health minister S S Negi directed the Uttarakhand State AIDS Control Society (USACS) to come up with a plan to allow patients from financially weaker backgrounds easy access to the ART centres. \u201cMost patients below poverty line avoid the trips for they cannot afford the expenses. I hope the scheme will be implemented as soon as possible,\u201d said Negi. A round trip to one of the two ART centres costs anywhere between Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 per person depending on the distance. Reportedly, USACS tried to implement the scheme last year and even sent an estimate for the purpose to the transport corporation. However, the estimated figures were allegedly much higher than needed. \u201cThe estimate quoted an amount in excess of Rs 45 lakhs. Patients travel to ART centres just once in a month or two to collect medicines. In fact, these days there are link ART centres in every district so only a handful will travel to Dehradun or Haldwani,\u201d said an official on condition of anonymity. According to sources, the transport corporation asked the health department to reimburse the amount spent on the free tours \u2013 a proposition the department refuse. \u201cIndeed, the government is providing us the medication.

Estimates by National Aids Control Organization (NACO), which works under the ministry of health and family welfare, show over 22 million people were tested during 2013-14, of which 2,40,234 people were found HIV positive. This included over 12,000 pregnant women who were diagnosed with the virus. \u201cThe low level of awareness among HIV positive population is of concern because research shows that early diagnosis is crucial. It allows patients to start on treatment sooner, which can greatly reduce the risk of spreading the infection to partners. Detecting the virus early also improves health outcomes for infected patients,\u201d said Gerald Schochetman, senior director, Infectious Diseases and Diagnostic Research, Abbott. Government officials as well as health experts say the risk is more among the vulnerable population that practises high risk behaviour or have higher chances of HIV prevalence. This includes sex workers, trans-genders and even long-distance truckers. Over the years, counselling and testing centres across the country have increased with many private laboratories now offering HIV detection tests apart from the government centres. In 1997, there were just 67 HIV testing and counselling sites in India, whereas NACO data shows there over 15,000 healthcare facilities offering counselling and testing across the country in 2014. \u201cCounselling and testing services are important components of prevention and control of AIDS in the country,\u201d said Anand Grover, founder-president of Lawyers Collective. Grover said instead of cutting corners with the vulnerable population by criminalizing them, government should counsel and provide them with proper care so that they do not transmit the disease further. \u201cIn the past few years, the number of infections has declined in India because we worked with the vulnerable population, distributed condoms and made them aware. One needs to partner them so that they help in not increasing the burden,\u201d Grover said. The UN estimates that India currently has the third largest population of HIV infected people in the world. There are over 2.09 million HIV patients in India, with the north, south and northeast regions accounting for the majority of patients."}

The stock of drugs meant for the national programme to control HIV has been empty in the past two months. Patients are being provided with medicines from an earlier stock and some drugs are bought locally. Since the medicines are scarce and can\u2019t be given out in bulk, patients have to make frequent, often daily, trips to the centres for their drugs, though there is no assurance that they would get them. Some have even stopped visiting the centres because of the daily travel and also because they often have to return empty-handed. \u201cMany HIV-positive children are not living to see their second birthday,\u201d said Eldred Tellis from Mumbai Aids Forum, adding that Maharashtra Aids Control Society had shown little urgency to procure anti-retroviral medicines.

Tellis cautioned that for patients, who had been going without medication for months, drugs would stop working and the people would end up with an increased viral load. Around 1.80 lakh people in the state are on anti-retrovial treatment. According to Vikas Ahuja from Network of Positive People, red tape in the tendering process has been delaying the procurement of medicines. Moreover, he said, Roche Diagnostics, only supplier for National Aids Control Organisation, had raised the rates of viral testing kits and the state was not willing to pay. JJ Hospital\u2019s ART centre does not have the viral load testing facility for almost a year. \u201cThe viral load test reports are imperative to start patients on second-line treatment,\u201d said Ahuja.

HIV is evolving to become less deadly and less infectious, according to a major scientific study led by British scientists. The team at the University of Oxford has shown that it was taking longer for HIV infection to cause AIDS. The rapid evolution of HIV, which has allowed the virus to develop resistance to patients\u2019 natural immunity is at the same time slowing the virus\u2019s ability to cause AIDS. The study also indicates that people infected by HIV are likely to progress to AIDS more slowly \u2014 in other words the virus becomes less virulent \u2014 because of widespread access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Both processes make an important contribution to the overall goal of the control and eradication of the HIV epidemic. Scientists said: \u201cTwenty years ago the time to AIDS was 10 years, but in the last 10 years in Botswana that might have increased to 12.5 years. One might imagine as time extends this could stretch further and further and in the future people being asymptomatic for decades.\u201d In 2013, there were a total of 35 million people living with HIV worldwide according to the World Health Organization. The study was led by researchers at the University of Oxford, along with scientists from South Africa, Canada, Tokyo, Harvard University and Microsoft Research.

Anything we can do to increase the pressure on HIV in this way may allow scientists to reduce the destructive power of HIV over time.\u201d Bill Clinton, former US president, addresses the crowd at a musical concert organized to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS on World AIDS day in New York City, on December 1, 2014. The research was carried out in Botswana and South Africa, two countries that have been worst affected by the HIV epidemic. Across those countries, researchers enrolled over 2000 women with chronic HIV infection to take part in the study. The first part of the study looked at whether the interaction between the body\u2019s natural immune response and HIV leads to the virus becoming less virulent. READ ALSO: Medicines, test kit scarcity hits HIV therapy in India Central to this investigation are proteins in our blood called the human leukocyte antigens (HLA), which enable the immune system to differentiate between the human body's proteins and the proteins of pathogens. People with a gene that expresses a particular HLA protein called HLA-B57, are known to benefit from a protective effect to HIV. Infected patients with the HLA-B57 gene progress more slowly than usual to AIDS. College and Schoolstudents hold a giant red ribbon made by themselves during an event to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS on the World AIDS Day, in Fuyang, China, on December 1, 2014. This study showed that in Botswana, where HIV has evolved to adapt to HLA-B57 more than in South Africa, patients no longer benefit from this gene\u2019s protective effect. However, the team\u2019s data show that the cost of this adaptation to HIV is that its ability to replicate is significantly reduced, therefore making the virus less virulent. The authors show that viral adaptation to protective gene variants, such as HLA-B57, is driving down the virulence of transmitted HIV and is thereby contributing to HIV elimination. In the second part of the study the authors examined the impact of ART on HIV virulence. They developed a mathematical model, which concluded that selective treatment of people with low CD4 counts will accelerate the evolution of HIV variants with a weaker ability to replicate."}

In Mysuru district alone, they have detected 725 cases. In Mysuru district, about 14,000 HIV positive patients are registered at the three centres and 5,500 people are undergoing treatment, District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) officer Dr T Raghukumar said here on Monday. Speaking at a World AIDS Day event at JSS Nursing College, he said more patients are visiting the ART Centres for treatment due to awareness among public on HIV. Patients, including from neighbouring districts, have been undergoing treatment in the ART centres at Krishna Rajendra Hospital, Asha Kirana Hospital and JSS Hospital. Till October end this year, the centres tested 51,728 people, 776 of whom tested positive. Out of the 30,112 pregnant women tested, 37 were detected with HIV, he added. Treating pregnant women The centres are treating HIV positive pregnant women with a CD-4 cell count of 350 plus. The anti-retroviral course begins in the 14th week of pregnancy and goes on till they stop breast feeding. Besides, tests are conducted on infants four times till they reach 18 months of age, a doctor said. To create awareness among students, the DAPCU has set up 70 red ribbon clubs in pre-university and degree colleges in the district and 13 blood banks are functioning across the district. Public care can help them live longer HIV patients feel they can live long if they get proper care, love and affection from society. They also feel that self confidence plays a major role in it. Kantaraju, a HIV patient who runs an NGO, said patients must have self-confidence. Kantharaju, who tested HIV positive in 2008, runs 'Ananda Jyoti' to helps others get proper treatment and benefits from the government. He said the government has been providing free treatment for HIV positive people. Pointing out that nutritious food is as important as treatment and medicines, Kantaraju urged the government to offer free food for patients as many belong to poor and backward families. Another HIV patient from Hunsur, who did not wish to reveal her name, said, \"Though we did not know how we got affected, many look at us as if we had done something horrible. I have lost all hopes in life. I am living only for my children.\" She was detected with HIV in 2010, and has undergoing treatment at the ART Centre at Krishnarajendra Hospital since then. \"If people like me get moral support from neighbours, we can lead a normal happy life,\" she added."}

But, what\u2019s bothering doctors and counsellors working with people living with HIV/AIDS is the casual attitude of the infected persons. Despite counselling, many don\u2019t take any precautions and pass on the infection to his/her partner. The ART (anti-retroviral therapy) center located in Goa medical college (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, receives many such cases. At the end of the day, the staff members find themselves exasperated when a new case of HIV is detected, and the source of infection is one of the patients taking treatment at the center. \u201cAnd we wonder whether we are doing any good to the society. We help them get well, and they go out and spread infection,\u201d said a ART staff member who recently dealt with a case of a 24-year-old man, who gave infection to his wife. When he walked in the center a year ago, he was thoroughly counselled along with his mother and told not to get married. \u201cNot only did he marry a HIV negative girl, but within a year had his 19-year-old wife infected, and now he wants to have a child too,\u201d said a ART member. \u201cI wanted somebody to take care of my son,\u201d was the mother\u2018s lame excuse when questioned about her son's marriage. The staff at the ART center has tried its best to dissuade him from having a child, but he is adamant. \u201cWe have even told him that the baby may be born HIV positive. But you know, what he said? \u2018You people will cure him\u2019. The staff member said she was infuriated when he heard him say that. A counsellor said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that all don\u2019t listen, but then there\u2019s no way we can do anything other than telling them what they should and should not do.\u201d \u201cWhen we counsel them, they hear us with rapt attention. When we ask whether they will follow our instructions, they answer in the affirmative. But some chose to defy us,\u201d she adds. She also said that some of the commercial sex workers who visit the ART center to collect their regular dose of medicines, have been spotted by them soliciting customers. Dr Vandana Patankar, project director, Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS), said this type of attitude is evident among HIV/AIDS patients as they want to prove to others that they are normal. \u201cThey want to also hide their infection also because of stigma attached to HIV/AIDs,\u201d she said further adding they are doing all they can do to generate awareness about HIV/AIDS."}

The house is in ward No. 13 of Kamarhati Municipality. Her husband, who was a grocer, had committed suicide in May after being hounded by neighbours following the HIV Positive diagnosis during tests prior to a brain tumor operation.

But, my husband could not take the torture by neighbours and committed suicide on May 17,\u201d the widow recounted.

However, as HIV-1 has a unique ability to lie dormant for years, the virus-affected cells will have to be continuously monitored to plan the treatment. So, here comes a non-invasive biosensor that can measure what is going on within HIV-1 infected cells in real time, all thanks to a joint research by teams from IISc here and the International Centre for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology (ICGEB) and Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi. Scientists said that the technology can offer insights that can help in controlling AIDS infection and also provide insight on interactions between HIV-1 and the tuberculosis causing bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb),within the cells. The team has devised a non-invasive biosensor methodology for precise measurements of glutathione (GHS), an anti-oxidant which works as a protective shield. Glutathione levels are indicators of the level of infection. The team says fluctuation of GSH levels detected by the biosensor also helps understand the expression of antioxidant genes and related pathways during latent and active stages of infection. \u201cEarlier methods use whole cell or tissue extracts, which destroy detailed information related to the GSH levels in different areas within an infected cell. We\u2019ve discovered that a modest increase in oxidative stress is sufficient to reactivate virus from latency. This may allow researchers to adopt a \u2018shock-and-kill\u2019 strategy in which virus could be reactivated by oxidative stress inducing compounds and subsequently killed by current anti-HIV drugs,\u201d the team\u2019s study says. Amit Singh of IISc says the sensitivity and specificity of this biosensor could be further used in understanding the physiological changes in HIV-1 infected cells and the mechanism of drug action. Importantly, he says, \u201cWe also discovered that Mycobacterium tuberculosis, another major human pathogen, specifically disturbs glutathione balance to increase the replication of HIV. Since TB is the major cause of HIV related deaths, our findings have major mechanistic and therapeutic potential for both TB and AIDS (among the main causes of human death).\u201d According to information from the ministry of health and family welfare, Karnataka has 1,07,664 AIDS patients and 6,751 of them are below the age of 15 (see table)."}

The district also had the dubious distinction of being the \"HIV capital' in undivided Andhra Pradesh in the last two years. If the data available with Andhra Pradesh State Aids Control Society (APSACS) is any indication, Guntur had the highest number of HIV positive cases since 2012-13. Guntur district registered 5,195 (including 2,498 female) HIV positive cases during 2013-2014 and 6,027 cases (2,938 female) during the previous year. Hyderabad, which tops the HIV positive chart in Telangana state, reported 3,952 (2,525 female) cases during 2013-14. APSACS conducts sampling of HIV cases in general population for both men and women, and pregnant women at antenatal care units separately every three months. The data shows that though the number of cases had come down in Guntur and Hyderabad, HIV positive cases have gone up in AP post bifurcation. In AP, East Godavari has the second highest number of HIV positive cases (4,191 in 2013- 2014 and 5,598 cases in 2012-2013).

Mahbubnagar tops the list in the number of cases of pregnant women affected by AIDS. Officials attribute the high prevalence in Krishna, Guntur, and East and West Godavari districts to the presence of more number of ports and heavy traffic on national highways. \"Though we are able to convince people that one can live long even after contracting HIV, about 20% of HIV positive cases lose hope and stop taking medicines,\" said an official. APSACS will soon develop district-level societies for AIDS control with single window system for the benefit of patients. Meanwhile, APSACS secured permission from National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) for AP and Telangana units. A separate AIDS control society will be created for T state. APSACS has been faced with fund crunch for the last one year. The allocation from NACO has come down from Rs 158 crore during the last financial year to Rs 121 crore this year.

This has raised a serious question about the quality of blood transfused to unsuspecting patients in the state. For many - like the parents of 30-odd thalassaemic children who suffered a double whammy when they got HIV infections after regular transfusions - the figures are a chilling reality. Experts point out that a wide range of factors, including medical negligence, three-month window period of the HIV virus where the virus is not diagnosed by the ELISA test, failed testing mechanisms in public health and wrong information provided by patients, contribute to the high figures of HIV spread through transfusion. \"In the past, complaints of instances of sample pooling for HIV testing have been raised which compromises test results. Since pooling of samples dilutes the viral load of a positive sample, many times it does not get detected and is passed on to a patient,\" a senior microbiologist in Ahmedabad told TOI. The CBI, in its report in the Junagadh case, has said that there was negligence in testing of blood samples and recommended stringent compliance by blood banks. It however did not have evidence to prove a criminal offence. J P Gupta, health commissioner and project director of Gujarat State Aids Control Society (GSACS) says there is no foolproof testing method to completely eliminate the HIV virus - which has a three-month window when it is not picked by regular testing - from the public health delivery domain. A petition was moved in the high court for use of the more advanced PCR testing instead of ELISA. The court however said that the issue was better left to experts when it was furnished in court that using the expensive PCR testing can prove detrimental in a public health scenario, and make blood unaffordable to a majority if mandated. Dr Rajendra Gadhvi, joint director GSACS, says Gujarat is the highest voluntary blood donating state - an average of 7-9 lakh blood units are donated annually. He says the figure of 1,685 cases through blood transfusion is arrived at from case histories recorded by patients. \"In India, where sex is still taboo, many patients give an incorrect history to save themselves embarrassment. In many cases, people record transfusion as the cause instead of unsafe sex.\""}

The device, developed by a team of researchers led by Samuel K Sia, associate %professor at Columbia University School of Engineering and Applied Science, can perform a point-of-care test that simultaneously detects three infectious disease markers. %The device replicates, for the first time, all %mechanical, optical and electronic functions of a lab-based blood test, researchers said. The device performs an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) without requiring any stored energy: all necessary power is drawn from the smartphone. It performs a triplexed immunoassay not currently available in a single test format: HIV antibody, treponemal-specific antibody for syphilis, and non-treponemal antibody for active syphilis infection. The accessory or dongle easily connects to a smartphone or computer and was recently piloted by health care workers in Rwanda who tested whole blood obtained via a finger prick from 96 patients who were enrolling into prevention-of-mother-to-child-transmission cli8nics or voluntary counselling and testing centers. \"Our work shows that a full laboratory-quality immunoassay can be run on a smartphone accessory,\" said Sia. \"Coupling microfluidics with recent advances in consumer electronics can make %certain lab-based diagnostics accessible to %almost any population with access to sm-8%art8phones. This kind of capability can tr8ansform how health care services are de8livered around the world,\" he said. Sia's %team developed the dongle to be small and light enough to fit into one hand. and to run assays on disposable plastic cassettes with pre-loaded reagents, where disease-specific zones provided an objective read-out, much like an ELISA assay. Sia estimates the dongle will have a manufacturing cost of USD 34, much lower than the USD 18,450 that typical ELISA equipment runs. The team made two main innovations to the dongle to achieve low power consumption, a must in places that do not always have electricity. The researchers eliminated the power-consuming electrical pump by using a \"one-push vacuum,\" where a user mechanically activates a negative-pressure chamber to move a sequence of reagents pre-stored on a cassette. The process is durable, requires little user training, and needs no maintenance or additional manufacturing. Sia's team removed the need for a battery by using the audio jack for transmitting power and for data transmission. And, because audio jacks are standardised among smartphones, the dongle can be attached to any compatible smart device in a plug-and-play manner. The research is published in the journal Science Translational Medicine."}

Engaging in unprotected sex with multiple partners increases the risk of contracting multiple strains of HIV. Once inside a host, these strains can recombine into a new variant of the virus, researchers said. One such recombinant variant observed in patients in Cuba appears to be much more aggressive than other known forms of HIV, researchers said. Before it can enter human cells, HIV must first anchor itself to them. The virus does this via anchor points, or co-receptors, which are proteins on the cell membrane. In a normal infection, the virus first uses the anchor point CCR5. In many patients, after a number of healthy years, the virus then switches to the anchor point CXCR4. This co-receptor switch coincides with a faster progression to AIDS. Researchers at KU Leuven's Laboratory for Clinical and Epidemiological Virology in Belgium have described a recombinant form of HIV observed in patients in Cuba that makes this transition much faster. The virus targets the anchor point CXCR4 early after infection, shortening drastically the healthy phase and triggering rapid progression to AIDS. The transition from anchor point CCR5 to CXCR4 is normally very difficult. Researchers suspect that the rapid transition observed in this HIV recombinant occurs as a result of combining fragments from different HIV subtypes."}

When we confronted her, she said that only one kit was available and pregnant women are their priority,\u201d he said. At the Kashmere Gate ICTC, Mallika, a transgender, was twice denied the test for the same reason. Herself an activist, Mallika is worried as \u201cconvincing transgenders to take the tests is very difficult. Now, with no kits, the disease will only spread. When we asked the counsellors, they said there is shortage at the government level\u201d. Some members of the community are convinced that the government has intentionally pulled the plug from the programme. \u201cMy partner and I are experiencing symptoms of HIV. We are both very anxious and now kits aren\u2019t available. I think the government is looking for ways to finish off the community,\u201d Kunal, who went to Hindu Rao Hospital for the test but had to return without it done, said. A counsellor working at Aruna Asaf Ali hospital in Civil Lines confirmed the shortage. \u201cEven if a kit is available, we ask them to get gloves, syringes and vacuum tubes as there is acute shortage,\u201d she said. Since there are no funds, even reports are sometimes given verbally. The 92 NGOs associated with the government AIDS awareness programme haven\u2019t been paid for the past seven months and many are now pulling out. Rupika, an NGO worker, is working without salary for eight months. \u201cWe want Delhi government to intervene immediately,\u201d she said. The community is now planning to meet chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at one of his Janta Darbars. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t help, we will have to protest outside Delhi secretariat,\u201d a transgender said."}

Researchers found that the new drug candidate blocks every strain of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus) that has been isolated from humans or rhesus macaques, including the hardest-to-stop variants. It also protects against much-higher doses of virus than occur in most human transmission and does so for at least eight months after injection. \u201cOur compound is the broadest and most potent entry inhibitor described so far,\u201d said Michael Farzan, from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI). When HIV infects a cell, it targets the CD4 lymphocyte, an integral part of the body\u2019s immune system. HIV fuses with the cell and inserts its own genetic material and transforms the host cell into a HIV manufacturing site. The new study builds on previous discoveries by the Farzan laboratory, which show that a co-receptor called CCR5 contains unusual modifications in its critical HIV-binding region, and that proteins based on this region can be used to prevent infection. Farzan and his team developed the new drug candidate so that it binds to two sites on the surface of the virus simultaneously, preventing entry of HIV into the host cell. \u201cWhen antibodies try to mimic the receptor, they touch a lot of other parts of the viral envelope that HIV can change with ease,\u201d said TSRI Research Associate Matthew Gardner, the first author of the study with Lisa M Kattenhorn of Harvard Medical School. The team also leveraged preexisting technology in designing a delivery vehicle - an engineered adeno-associated virus, a small, relatively innocuous virus that causes no disease. Once injected into muscle tissue, like HIV itself, the vehicle turns those cells into \u201cfactories\u201d that could produce enough of the new protective protein to last for years, perhaps decades, Farzan said."}

As of Monday , the state has secured consent letters from farmers for 22,220 acres for the construction of the capital as against the target of 30,000 acres. Apparently, as many as 12,343 of the 20,000 farmers in the region have given their consent. With the state extending the deadline to give consent to February 28, AP officials were confident that the remaining 8,000 acres needed would be acquired by then. \u201cThis is the biggest land pooling exercise in the country . All the land pooled so far is private land, no government land has been acquired,\u201c Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) commissioner N Srikanth told TOI. Majority of the farmers from Tulluru village cited many reasons for agreeing to part with their land. One was a wish to quit the hard toil of farming while another was the promise of a large lump sum of money . \u201cI am 38 years old now, I work hard day and night in the field and can expect money to only trickle in. Now, I am being offered a chance to make quick bucks and want to cash in on it,\u201c Kranti, a farmer from Tulluru, said. Like Kranti, most farmers hardly needed much persuasion to part with their land. What seems to guide many is the tantalizing hope of clearing their debts and starting life anew. \u201cI have piled up huge debts and am unable to marry off my children. Now, I hope to do so,\u201c said Raghunath Rao, a farmer from Krishnayapalem. Another reason for wanting to bid goodbye to farming is that their children have taken to other professions.Sources said the children of many farmers have moved to Vijayawada or Hyderabad or even abroad. As a result, with no helping hands, at least 15 per cent of land owners here have given their land to tenant farmers for cultivation.\u201cMany farmers told us that their children want them to give up farming and move to the cities to lead a retired life,\u201c revenue officials said. Yet another reason for the farmers to part with their land is that they belong to the Kamma community and are traditional supporters of the TDP . Of the 26 villages where the land pooling exercise is on, nearly 18 of them are dominated by the Kamma community . But the battle is far from over for the state. While Tulluru and a few other villages have given their consent, many others are hardly willing to. This means that getting the remaining 8,000 acres will not be easy."}

The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) runs TB centre at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College (IGGMC) since 2007. Now, under the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) it will soon use the latest equipment and testing tool called CBNAAT (cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test). This is meant for HIV positive patients, who are extremely prone to get TB as a secondary infection due to the drastic fall in their immunity. The centre has already procured the CBNAAT equipment (commonly called as gene Xpert) under the RNTCP. It will be installed in a specially created laboratory for it in the IGGMC premises on March 24. Dr Sadaf Khateeb, medical officer of NMC\u2019s TB centre, said that this test has emerged as a boon to HIV patients, who are usually also suffering from TB. \"Under the RNTCP programme, and as per WHO guidelines, we have been told to put all co-infected or HIV positive and suspected TB patient to this test. This can diagnose the patient for TB in general as well as the multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB within two hours. Since the instrument generates an automated report, the test can be conducted even by a laboratory technician,\" she said. Though the centre is meant for only patients living within NMC limits, all patients found to be HIV positive at the Anti-Retro-viral Therapy (ART) centre of IGGMC, the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) or other NMC hospitals can be referred for TB and MDR-TB diagnosis here. \u201cGeneral TB patients still have to be diagnosed using the culture test, which takes about 3-5 months. But HIV positive patients suspected to be suffering from TB cannot be made to wait so much. Hence, such patients from all over the city, region and neighbouring states who come to government hospitals here can be sent to the NMC centre,\u201d said Dr Khateeb. He said that cases of non-pulmonary (or non-lung) TB patients are on the rise in general but their percentage is higher in HIV positive patients. They are commonly diagnosed with abdominal TB, cervical lymph nodes (on the neck) etc. The HIV positive patients who are suffering from TB generally test negative in conventional smear test. But with CBNAAT, it will now be possible to easily diagnose them for TB or MDR-TB as soon as their ART treatment is started once they are referred to the NMC centre. In 2014, the centre had registered over 200 TB patients. Of these, 95% were tested for MDR and some 25-30 patients were HIV positive too. Hence, CBNAAT is set to change the diagnosis and naturally the treatment scenario of HIV positive and TB patients for the better.

Coming to terms with the fact she and her six-year-old daughter are HIV positive, the 30-year-old daily wage worker is also faced with another challenge. Her daughter is underweight and Lakshmi is unable to provide her with nutritious meals because she has to spend most of her earnings on medicines. \"I can only afford rice, not green leafy vegetables, milk and eggs that the doctor advised for my daughter. Where will I find the money for it,\" she says. Lakshmi is not the exception. A study conducted by the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT) in the city found that more than half the children (59%) living with HIV hail from families that do not have reliable access to sufficient quantity of affordable and nutritious food, leading to malnutrition. This is mainly because HIV hits the productive age groups the most, causing a dip in the family income and reduced food availability for the entire household. The study shows that the effect of food insecurity in these families has left 72% of children above five and living with HIV underweight, about 69% with stunted growth and 76% wasting (low weight for height). The proportion was high especially when compared to data from the National Family Health Survey which shows the national average for underweight children and those with stunted growth below the age of five varies between 40 and 50% and between 48 and 60% respectively. READ ALSO: Four states in south make up 50% of HIV cases The 147 children aged between one and 15 years surveyed for the study conducted at the anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centre of a government tertiary-care hospital were either under the care of a single parent, mostly the mother as the father had died of HIV, or under foster care. \"Food insecurity in households is a problem across the country and one might ask why only children with HIV. Infections like HIV are catabolic diseases which results in diminished muscle mass and body fat. So, the daily dietary need of those with HIV is more,\" says C Padmapriyadarsini, scientist, NIRT. READ ALSO: HIV may stay hidden in 'quiet' immune cells Since malnutrition in early childhood has a spiralling effect leading to decreased cognitive, psychosocial and physical development which would affect the academic performance of the child, NIRT has recommended measures to complement the ART course. While Anti-Retroviral Therapy has been effective in controlling the disease, the study suggests interventions like targeted food assistance to the families. READ ALSO: What makes HIV vaccines backfire? Padmapriyadarsini says that a nutritional supplement would also go a long way in increasing adherence to drug management and improving nutritional status. The drugs would then act better on the individual without adverse effects and it would enhance a child's development.

The study was done in association with Institute of Child Health and Hospital For Children and Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society. NIRT now hopes that it can convince policymakers to adopt a similar strategy on a broader level. According to the National AIDS Control Organisation, there are 6,504 children living with HIV/AIDS in Tamil Nadu. Of these, 2,201 are boys and 1,849 are girls aged below 15, who are on ART as of September 2014."}

Also, high HIV prevalence among youth, pregnant women and adults remain a cause of concern. In the third part of series on Millennium Development Goals (MDG) achieved by state, TOI analyses how Chhattisgarh and neighbouring MP fare on both parameters at national level. Goal 5: Improve Maternal Health Among major states, maternal mortality rate (MMR) (i.e. maternal deaths per one lakh live births), ranges from 61 in Kerala to 300 in Assam (highest) in 2011-13. MMR in BIMARU states of Bihar/Jharkhand (208), Madhya Pradesh/Chhattisgarh (221), Rajasthan (244), Uttar Pradesh/Uttarakhand (285) and Orissa (222) was reportedly much higher than all India level estimates (167). Four states UP, Bihar, MP/CG and Rajasthan together contributed to 67% of MMR in the country. Chhattisgarh and MP were also going to miss MDG target for 2015 (150.7) by a huge margin of 40 points. Maternal mortality rate (MM Rate), number of maternal deaths in age 15 to 49 per lakh of women was also among highest (20.2), only below UP and Rajasthan and almost double that of national average (11.7). Life time risk or probability that, one women of reproductive age (15 to 49) will die due to child birth within six weeks after delivery was 0.7%, higher than average. As per the sample registration system estimates of 2011-13, 68% of maternal deaths were women in the age group of 20 to 29 years. Though Madhya Pradesh along with Andhra Pradesh is expected to achieve universal coverage of births by skilled health personnel up in 2015, the proportion has actually dipped in the state from 2009 where it was 56.4% and would be 50.5% in 2015. Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria There have been around 2,500 deaths because of HIV/AIDS in 2011 (last available date). This was lower than MP\u2019s 3,324 while highest was Andhra Pradesh (31,347). However, prevalence of HIV in youth, young pregnant women and adults was much higher than MP and more than national average in youth category while at par in the rest. Also Chhattisgarh reported double the number of new infections (4,565) than MP (2,387)in 15+ age group which is a cause for concern. This could be attributed due to the fact that condom use rate was lower in Chhattisgarh than MP (2.9 and 4.8 respectively). Both states were also lower on condom use rate among contraceptives use in India (5.2). While female sterilizations remain the preferred choice of contraceptives in both urban and rural pollution, it doesn\u2019t protect against HIV incidence. MP and Chhattisgarh reported more than two lakh malaria cases in 2014 out of the 10.7 lakh total cases in the country with over a lakh cases reported from the latter state. MP reported more deaths in 2013 but fewer deaths than Chhattisgarh in 2014. More than a 1,000 deaths were reported pan India in 2013 and 2014. 85% cases in 2014 in CG were caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasite, which is critical as it is prone to develop severity and death."}

He also assured the students that his trust will create more awareness about AIDS among people, especially those in rural areas, in the days to come."}

However, children with the disease often can\u2019t avail of them, mostly because there is no one to look after them and take them to the hospital. An organization run by an American has come to the rescue of more than 3,000 children living with HIV (CLHIV) from the city. Jerry Hughes from Minnesota, USA, has been coming to the city for the last 10 years to spread awareness about HIV-AIDS and inspire PLHIVs to be optimistic. Through the Hughes Foundation, he has also made considerable contributions to the lives of positive people in Namibia and India. Having shifted base to the city in December, after leaving a well paying job and a promising career in advertising, Jerry now plans to focus all his energies on helping HIV positive children and women of the region. \u201cFor ten years, I have been visiting Nagpur off and on to interact with PLHIVs and activists here. I felt like the place and the people were beckoning me to help and contribute in any way I could. It led to what I call \u2018India 10.0\u2019, a project in which we aim to change the face of AIDS in India. We have started with 17 orphans who are HIV positive,\u201d said Jerry, himself an HIV positive person. For two months now, an old, beat up car is being used to cater to the health needs of these and other kids with the infection. The organization also runs a pen pal programme for women suffering from the disease, where they write emails to students at Jerry\u2019s alma mater, the University of Minnesota. His ultimate goal is to start a centre that provides free treatment, counselling and creates awareness about the disease. The kids under the project have been provided for by a corporate group from the city while activist Samir Shinde has been looking after them for the past four years. \u201cThese are children who require special care in terms of health, nutrition, medication and developmental issues. They are also prone to becoming sick more often. Therefore, we also arrange a lot of fun activities \u2013 picnics, games, movie nights \u2013 to help their cognitive development,\u201d he said. These activities also help in lightening the burdened souls of the kids. \u201cHIV and people suffering from it often paint a dull, drab picture. Personally, I would like to give it a facelift, bringing in an element of hope and fun,\u201d said Jerry. This has already begun in the form of a 1930s Hollywood-style promotional video and \u2018scooter cam\u2019, a series of social experiment videos on topics like, \u2018Does mosquito bites cause HIV?\u2019 put up on the various social media platforms of the foundation."}

Data released by Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS) indicates a drop in HIV/AIDS cases since 2009, thanks to extensive awareness about HIV/AIDS through a network of NGOs, and early detection which paved the way for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) given free at ART centres. A HIV positive person on ART therapy can to a large extent lead a healthy life. In 2013, 505 new cases were detected whereas in 2014 the number fell to 449. Vandana Pathankar, project director, GSACS, said that on April 1 they completed 10 years of introduction of ART therapy in Goa. While initially there was only one ART centre located in Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, Bambolim, which catered to over 1,000 patients, where free anti-retroviral drugs were made available, subsequently link ART plus centers were opened in the South Goa district hospital, Margao, sub-district hospital, Ponda and Cottage hospital, Chicalim. A large number of HIV infections occurred through the perinatal route, and annual infections through this route were between 4 to 5%. The GSACS has adopted Prevention of Parent-to-child Transmission (PPTCT) strategy which is considered cost-effective method in controlling the virus via this route. This programme basically helps effective reduction of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection by providing quality antenatal care including preventive services. Since introduction of this programme, HIV prevalence rate among antenatal mothers who accepted HIV test has decreased from 1.48 %, in 2003 to 0.18 in 2013. GSACS\u2019s annual bulletin has revealed that 89% of the spouses who opted for HIV test were tested positive, and HIV prevalence directly in labour has decreased from 2.46% in 2003 to 0% in 2013. Also, prominent change noted by GSACS is that the proportion of direct walk-in persons undergoing HIV testing has registered a steep increase \u2014 this is also true of female patients. Currently, GSACS also focuses on improving HIV/AIDs awareness, controlling sexually transmitted diseases (STD), including condom promotion, and ensuring availability of safe blood and blood products. Another focus area of GSACS is ART. The ART, though it does not cure HIV, it slows down the virus from multiplying so fewer viruses attack the immune system once an HIV positive person starts the treatment, says a doctor at GSACS. An HIV positive person on ART therapy can to a large extent lead a healthy life but subject to good adherence to the first line of ART. The GSACS now offers at GMC\u2019s ART centre the second line of ART also which was not available in Goa earlier. HIV patients with a failure of first line of ART, were referred to J J Hospital, Mumbai."}

However, there is one vaccine that has been found to cut TB disease incidence in India by half \u2014 food. Chronic lack of adequate food is the reason for more than half of the TB infections here progressing to become a fullblown disease, says a study. In an international publication 'Eradicating TB - Challenges, Perspectives, Solutions', of the Observer Research Foundation, experts from across the world and India stressed on the need for India's TB control programme to take into account the role of social conditions such as rising inequity, malnutrition, poverty and over-crowding in the spread of TB. Even though 40% of the Indian population or 480 million people carry the TB bug within their body, TB cases annually is estimated to be 2.3 million, a fraction of those who carry the infection. \"Over 90% of those carrying the TB bug are able to prevent the infection from becoming TB disease with the help of the body's immune system. Anything that reduces the strength of one's immunity, like lack of good nutritious food, increases the risk of contracting TB,\" explained Dr Anurag Bhargava of the Himalayan Institute of Medicine and an expert on TB treatment. Instead of Direct Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS), a World Health Organisation (WHO) concept, Dr Bhargava felt that it might be more effective to have a programme more suited to Indian needs called DOST\u2014Directly Observed and Supported Treatment \u2013 which would offer TB patients and their families nutritional support and counselling through behavorial change of healthcare providers along with treatment. He added that several studies have shown that unlike many African countries, where HIV is the biggest risk factor for TB, in India, 55% of TB is attributable to under nutrition. An annual estimated mortality of 2, 70,000 deaths means that TB claims one life in India every two minutes. According to R S Gupta, former deputy director general of the Central TB Division in India, malnutrition is one of the primary reasons for the high incidence of TB. \"TB patients suffers from loss of appetite, nutrient malabsorption, micronutrient malabsorption and altered metabolism, which leads to wasting. Deficiency in proteins and micronutrients increases the risk of TB. It has been found that malnourished TB patients have delayed recovery and higher mortality rates than well-nourished patients,\" said Gupta. \"It cannot be stressed enough that without ensuring better nutrition and environmental conditions, mere medication, no matter how good and effectively administered, is unlikely to solve the problem,\" said Harsh Sethi of the Observer Research Foundation. He added that, an underfed citizenry forced to live in unsanitary surroundings is unlikely to respond favourably to medical care."}

The BioSure HIV Self Test, which claims to have a 99.7 per cent accuracy rate, works in a similar way to a pregnancy test, measuring levels of antibodies in a person's blood. The test detects antibodies on a small drop of blood, taken from the finger-tip using a lancet. These antibodies are often only detectable three months after the HIV infection is caught. Two purple lines appear if the result is positive. Further blood tests are recommended if both lines appear. However, if the test is negative experts say it does not mean people are definitely virus free. The three-month window period, between the moment someone catches the infection and the time it can take for antibodies to develop, means the kit is not reliable during this time, 'BBC News' reported. It is hoped that the kit, which can be bought online, will reduce some of the 26,000 people estimated to have undiagnosed HIV in the UK. An early diagnosis allows people to get treatment quickly and can prevent serious complications. Individuals successfully treated for HIV are less likely to pass the infection on. \"We campaigned for a long time to secure the legalization of HIV self-test kits which happened in April 2014, so it is great to see the first self-test kits being approved,\" said Dr Rosemary Gillespie, chief executive at Terrence Higgins Trust. \"However, it is important to make sure people can get quick access to support when they get their result,\" Gillespie said."}

The test is a single use, disposable device and uses a single drop of blood from a finger prick. But it may not detect HIV infections that have occurred within three months. The technology is very similar to a human pregnancy test and detects specific antibodies in your blood sample. It has a proven clinical sensitivity (if a person has HIV how often the test will be positive) of 99.7%, which means that on average 997 in every 1,000 positive results will be correct. It has a proven clinical specificity (if a person doesn\u2019t have HIV how often will the test be negative) of 99.9%, which means that on average 999 in every 1,000 negative results will be correct. Experts advise that people who engage in activities that increase their risk of exposure to HIV, they should test regularly. One in four people living with HIV is currently unaware of their infection in England. UNAIDS recommends home testing and says people need to open up to it as fewer than half of those living with HIV knew their status. This is, therefore, a huge barrier to treatment scale up. In India, 40% of the 2.3 million people living with HIV don\u2019t know they are infected with the deadly virus. But India is against home testing for HIV. The country\u2019s National AIDS Control Organization has earlier said it is against allowing finger pricks or mouth swabs to be used by individuals to know their HIV status."}

Interestingly, more than 100 registered clinics and hospitals exist in the KMC\u2019s limits. Scared of another burden of documentation, the gynaecologists are staying out of the project, which was started by the Kolhapur unit in April 2013. The dull response has stalled the efforts of the unit to provide necessary help to HIV-infected expectants mothers and start necessary medication at the earliest. In the district, altogether 58 maternity homes have been registered for the project, which is being implemented by Pune-based NGO Prayas. The NGO and the unit have jointly discovered 16 cases of HIV positive expectant mothers with the help of maternity homes so far. \u201cWe were able to provide them assistance on time only because of the response from the maternity homes. Otherwise these mothers could have gone undetected and had given birth to HIV positive babies,\u201d said Deepa Shipurkar, programme officer of the Kolhapur unit. As part of the PPTCT project, the unit and Prayas jointly provide free kits to the hospitals, which they can use to detect whether the expectant mother is HIV-affected. If the results are positive, the hospitals are supposed to inform the unit. Thereafter, the unit and Prayas teams take care of the patient\u2019s medication. \u201cWe only require them to inform us; we don\u2019t demand anything else. We are constantly in touch with the city\u2019s gynaecologists and could enroll 17 of them for the project. However, we need almost all of them to join the project to make ensure that the city has zero HIV prevalence, especially among children,\u201d Shipurkar added. Since April 2013, maternity homes in city and districts have come across 20,000 patients and found 16 HIV positive cases. Now, after receiving lukewarm response from the doctors, Prayas is reaching out to the pathologists to get details about HIV positive expectant mothers. \u201cBesides these 17 hospitals in the city, we have a good network in Karvir and Hatkanangale talukas. Earlier, one of the hospitals in Jaysingpur was reluctant to join the project. However, it found an HIV positive case on the very first day of implementation of project.

And what does a poor, sick mother, desperately trying to ensure that her HIV positive orphaned child gets his essential daily dose of life-saving medicines get? Insensitivity, buck-passing and indolence by the government medical fraternity and the BSACS officials! On Thursday, incidentally observed as AIDS Orphans Day (part of the annual global Aids awareness week), a desperate 25-year-old widow in Chhapra was running from pillar to post in a frantic bid to obtain the next dose of ART for her eight-year-old son. An HIV positive person needs to take the prescribed medicine daily, just like a daily insulin dose for diabetics. If the dose is missed, even for a day, the immune system of the patient starts deteriorating. The people at the ART dispensing centre were helpless, stocks were over (The special ART formulation for children is given in a syrup form). When the woman, in desperation, went to submit a written intimation to the nodal medical officer, pleading that the medicine be made available, she was brushed aside. He refused to accept her application. The woman, a widow, who somehow ekes out a living working in a private school, is distraught. For the past five days, she has abandoned her work, running to and fro the dispensing centre. The irony is that the medication can only be obtained from the government centre and no private chemist shop in Chhapra stocks the medicine, which is very expensive. \u201cI went to get the medicines on the May 4, a day before the last dose ran out (This is the practice. Patients are given medicines for a month only, and they can\u2019t ask for any advance stock). There was no medicine available. My child is on ART since 2011. What\u2019s worrying me is that in January, when a CD-4 count was done, his platelet count had dropped to 311 from 1100. I\u2019m desperate,\u201d she said over the phone. Exactly 14 days ago, I happened to visit the Chhapra ART centre with RTI activist Sanjeet Singh, where the persons concerned told us that stocks were low. \u201cWe are just not receiving adequate stocks from BSACS, and we struggle to do what we can,\u201d they said. \u201cThe high court has decreed that every ART centre should have a two-month stock of ART medicines and medicines for opportunistic infections, but despite assurances from BSACS officials, see the situation!\u201d says Sanjeet. In Chhapra, the situation is overwhelming. Last month 1748 patients received ART. There are about 150 children on ART. NACO guidelines are not met. BSACS has not appointed the required staff. No medical officer, so obviously, no \u2018accountable\u2019 official! Pregnant women have to buy their own \u2018safe delivery kits\u2019 from private stores in Patna because the hospital has no stock. HIV positive pregnant women are denied surgery at Chhapra. The official line is, \u201cSo far, no such case has been brought to our notice.\u201d There is no CD4 testing machine, even though NACO funds were there for one unit in each district, it is said. The woman says, \u201cMy child is the only reason I am living, if he dies, I am nothing, I might as well destroy myself.\u201d Just as I write the finishing line to this article, Saturday 8am, I receive a phone call. The ART medicines have finally arrived, and will be given out today. Happy Mother\u2019s Day!"}

But he once again refused to carry out the delivery on April 1. This discriminatory behavior of doctor compelled the family to take the patient to Baba hospital. The complaint was submitted by NGO working for the HIV high-risk group patients in city thereafter."}

Estimates show a reduction of almost 90% in funding from various multilateral, bilateral and philanthropic donor organisations over the last three years, sources in the government as well as civil society said. While many multilateral organisations, including World Health Organisation (WHO) and several UN agencies such as UNICEF and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), have either drastically scaled down or diverted funds from India\u2019s HIV control programme to other countries, bilateral and even philanthropic donor organisations like Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Clinton Health Access Initiative and World Vision have slashed funding to the national programme. This is expected to create pressure on the health ministry, which is already struggling with a truncated health budget to fund its various schemes. Instead of financing AIDS control programme, many of the organizations, mainly the bilateral and philanthropic donors, have shifted focus to management of other diseases such as tuberculosis and family planning, sources said. This has led to fears that India may again lose ground in controlling emergence of new HIV-infected cases as it is at a very crucial juncture at present. India, which has the third highest number of estimated people living with HIV in the world, demonstrated an overall reduction of 57% in the annual new HIV infections among adult population from 2.74 lakh in 2000 to 1.16 lakh in 2011, according to the 2013-14 annual report of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO). The trend of annual AIDS related deaths have also shown a steady decline since the rollout of the free Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) programme in India in 2004. Government estimates show around 1.5 lakh lives have been saved due to the programme till 2011. Experts say the achievement was a result of various interventions and scaling-up of prevention strategies under the National AIDS Control Programme. However, a slowdown in funding and resource crunch can cause a potential damage. \u201cThe overall international funding has come down by almost 90% in last three years. This is challenging because India has just about managed to achieve 90% and the rest 10% is critical as we need to sustain the decline in new cases for at least another seven to eight years,\u201d says Rajesh Kumar, vice chair of Global Fund\u2019s country coordinating mechanism-India. Kumar, who is also Executive Director at the Society for the Promotion of Youth and Masses, says the situation is unfortunate because there is already a low health care budget. At present, Global Fund and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) are the two main organisations which are continuing with funding for AIDS control programme. Besides, the World Bank continues to fund such programmes through loans. According to Kumar, the withdrawal of funds by various multilateral organisations is also because of political decisions of both India as well as donor countries. While many of these organisations are short of funding, India\u2019s achievement in AIDS control has also led to many donor agencies diverting resources to areas where the need is more. For instance, Gates Foundation, which launched its AIDS prevention programme \u2018Avahan\u2019 in India in 2003 and was working with the government as well as NGOs and community groups, said in a note, \u201cBetween 2010 and 2012, the government gradually took ownership of the programme as planned.\u201d While the Foundation continues to support the government in HIV prevention, it is now more focused in other segments such as family planning, tuberculosis and sanitation."}

HIV has a voracious sweet tooth, which turns out to be its Achilles' heel, according to researchers from Northwestern Medicine and Vanderbilt University. After the virus invades an activated immune cell, it craves sugar and nutrients from the cell to replicate and fuel its wild growth throughout the body. READ ALSO: HIV losing its edge, evolving into milder form, study finds Scientists discovered the switch that turns on the immune cell's abundant sugar and nutrient pipeline. Then they blocked the switch with an experimental compound, shutting down the pipeline and, thereby, starving HIV to death. The virus was unable to replicate in human cells in vitro. The discovery may have applications in treating cancer, which also has an immense appetite for sugar and other nutrients in the cell, which it needs to grow and spread. \"This compound can be the precursor for something that can be used in the future as part of a cocktail to treat HIV that improves on the effective medicines we have today,\" said Harry Taylor, assistant professor in Medicine-Infectious Diseases. READ ALSO: First HIV self-test kit on sale in UK HIV needs to grow in a type of immune cell (CD4+ T-cell) that is active, meaning it is already responding to pathogens in the blood. Activation increases the T-cell's supplies of sugar and other critical nutrients needed for both cell and virus growth. Until now, no one knew the first step that signalled a newly activated T-cell to stock up on sugar and other nutrients. Those nutrients become the building blocks of genetic material the cell and the virus need to grow. Northwestern and Vanderbilt scientists figured out that the first step in stocking the T-cell's pantry involved turning on a cell component called phospholipase D1 (PLD1). Then they used an experimental compound to block PLD1 and shut down the pipeline. This is believed to be the first time scientists have targeted the virus's ability to pilfer the cell's pantry to stop its growth. READ ALSO: Antibody therapy manages to reduce 300-fold HIV\u2019s viral load The compound also slowed the proliferation of the abnormally activated immune cells, the study found. Current HIV medications stop HIV growth but do not affect the abnormal excess activation and growth of immune cells triggered by HIV. The excess immune cell growth is believed to contribute to the life-long persistence of HIV and leads to excess inflammation that causes premature organ damage in HIV patients - even when the virus is suppressed by current medicines. \"Perhaps this new approach, which slows the growth of the immune cells, could reduce the dangerous inflammation and thwart the life-long persistence of HIV,\" Taylor added. The study was published in the journal PLOS Pathogens. READ ALSO: New vaccine can improve HIV treatment"}

As per records with the State Aids Control Society (SACS), there are 2 lakh people who have tested positive for HIV in Telangana. Despite this startling figure, lack of enforcement of rules in blood banks is raising alarm among doctors. In fact, the society does not even have a record of those banks which do not comply with safety norms. \u201cEvery blood bank must be checked to see if they are following the proper protocol. It is during times of crisis, usually dur ing epidemics such as dengue, that blood units are pushed out before they are checked,\u201c said a senior SACS official, adding that it is a crime to send out blood without testing it. \"The government has made drug enforcement teams responsible for the checks.

Dr Ram Mohan, joint director, blood safety, SACS added: \u201cUsually, testing kits are provided at nominal rates. But there are many blood banks which do not follow testing protocol. It is the state blood transfusion council's prerogative to ensure that bad blood does not reach the public.\u201c Times View The government should immediately intervene and ensure that all blood units are properly checked before transfusion.

The mother told counsellors that her daughter had been cheated by the man, a driver. She had learnt later that the man was already married. Realizing that they had a case of child marriage, rape, polygamy and cheating on their hands, the counsellors asked for more details. On getting information from the mother, the counsellors recalled that they had received a similar complaint from a pregnant woman at Vanita Sahayavani two years ago. They looked into their files and realized that the man had been married thrice before and they'd received a complaint from another woman who said he had married her sister. The woman, who said her husband was HIV-positive, was pregnant and also infected. \"The woman had complained that her husband had eloped with her younger sister and made her pregnant. As the young woman was HIV-positive, we advised her to have an abortion. A year later, he got into a relationship with the young woman's cousin and she contracted the infection.

New research led by scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and the Rockefeller University shows in mice that the vaccine candidate can stimulate the immune system activity necessary to stop HIV infection. The findings could provide key information for the development of an effective AIDS vaccine, researchers said. The research, published in the journals Cell and Science, represents a leap forward in the effort to develop a vaccine against HIV, which has so far struggled to elicit antibodies (immune system molecules) that can effectively fight off different strains of the virus. \u201cThe results are pretty spectacular,\u201d said Dennis Burton, chairman of the TSRI department of immunology and microbial science. While many vaccines for other diseases use a dead or inactive version of the disease-causing microbe itself to trigger antibody production, immunisations with \u201cnative\u201d HIV proteins are ineffective in triggering an effective immune response, due to HIV\u2019s ability to evade detection from the immune system and mutate rapidly into new strains. This challenge has led researchers to believe that a successful AIDS vaccine will need a series of related, but slightly different proteins (immunogens) to train the body to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV- a twist on the traditional \u201cbooster\u201d shot, where a person is exposed to the same immunogen multiple times. The scientists tested one of these potential proteins, an immunogen called eOD-GT8 60mer, using a technique called B cell sorting. The researchers showed that immunisation with eOD-GT8 60mer produced antibody \u201cprecursors\u201d \u2014 with some of the traits necessary to recognize and block HIV infection. This suggested that eOD-GT8 60mer could be a good candidate to serve as the first in a series of immunisations against HIV, researchers said. \u201cThe vaccine appears to work well in our mouse model to \u2018prime\u2019 the antibody response,\u201d said TSRI professor David Nemazee."}

Over 182 projects that cater to nearly three lakh high-risk population in the state will suffer as distribution of condoms and syringes to availability of medicines and testing kits will take a direct hit. The circular issued on June 11 has asked NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs) to curtail the strength of their peer educators by 80% and outreach workers by 25%. A majority of these agencies have not received a dime from the state body since January this year, and therefore have been grappling with massive attrition due to non-payment of salaries. The sacking of peer educators and outreach workers will directly impact the distribution of condoms, lubricants and syringes in the state\u2019s most vulnerable pockets. Peer educators are members or leaders who belong to the high-risk community (female sex workers, transgenders and men having sex with men) and carry out the crucial task of distributing condoms and motivating people to get tested. The MSACS in its circular blamed the change in funding pattern of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) for the delay in receiving funds, which are likely to arrive only by October this year. However, TOI has learned that NACO had released around Rs 8 crore as a contingency measure, which has been lying with the state treasury for the past two months. Project director Khushalsinh Pardeshi could not be reached for comment. MSACS that presented an annual budget of Rs 130.12 crore had received only three-fourths of the money. The annual plan for 2015-2016 of nearly Rs 200 crore is yet to be approved by NACO, which has committed only 80% or less. Maharashtra till date remains one of the six high-risk states in the country with a prevalence rate of 0.40%. According to NACO\u2019s annual report, over 40,000 people had tested positive for HIV in 2013-2014 out of the 20 lakh who were tested, indicating that the HIV scare is still very pertinent. The fund crunch, said to be one of the worst for the state body, has already started affecting people living with HIV. The stock of anti-retroviral medicines that keep nearly 1.80lakh adults and 11,000 children alive is erratic. While NACO provides the ART drugs, MSACS would often financially support NGOS to locally purchase drugs if the drugs did not come on time. \u201cCBOs like us are struggling for existence. Who do you think will worry about some patients not getting medicines on time or progressing to the second line?\u201d asked a Pune-based agency that is thinking of giving up three of its projects. The crisis has also reached the state body\u2019s doorstep. Sources told TOI that the last lot of condoms has already been distributed to NGOs, while consumables required to draw blood and carry out HIV tests are long over at MSACS. Worse, the state body has run out of paper to print HIV test reports at several of its Integrated Centres for Counselling and Testing (ICTC). \u201cIt is appalling how a national programme used the services of female sex workers and transgenders and now wants to get rid of them. Many of them have left prostitution to work fully for the programme. What are we going to tell them?\u201d questioned Meena Seeshu, who runs three projects at Sangli. As per the state diktat, 40 of her peer educators stand to lose employment. \u201cWe suspect the rate of new infections is already going up,\u201d said a Pune-based NGO\u2019s director. Following the circular, at least two NGOs have communicated to MSACS that they will be withdrawing their projects with female sex workers and migrants. When TOI contacted NACO, a senior official from the finance department said that it is time the state bore some burden of the HIV programme. \u201cWe have formed a committee that will negotiate with state governments.

Transmitted through bodily fluids, the HIV-1 virus infects and destroys key immune cells, known as CD4 T cells, that would ordinarily mount a defense against the virus and initiate the antiviral activity of other immune cells. Scientists have long known that a substance produced by CD4 T cells called Interleukin-21 (IL-21) plays an important role in the immune system by activating immune cells that specialise in killing viruses like HIV-1 and driving the production of antibodies that attack them. However, it was unclear how IL-21 might affect the early stages of HIV-1 infection that allows the virus to grow and spread unabated soon after a person is exposed. Researchers from Weill Cornell Medical College, the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University conducted two studies to uncover this effect. The researchers created a culture from human tissues, primarily spleen and lymph node tissue. After exposing the cells to IL-21, they introduced HIV-1 and found that after 72 hours, cultures with IL-21 contained more than two-thirds less virus than those that didn't receive the treatment. The second model tested IL-21 in mice transplanted with human stem cells to create a physiological environment as close as possible to that in people. Over the course of two weeks, the mice began producing IL-21. After 14 days, more than half of the mice with IL-21 did not display a detectable level of HIV-1. An analysis of the results suggested that IL-21 not only jump starts the immune system but also stops the HIV-1 virus from replicating during a critical, early window of its development, when it is concentrated in one location and has not yet started to spread throughout the body. \"This study highlights components of the human immune system that are capable of mounting an antiviral response and driving intrinsic resistance to HIV-1,\" said senior author Dr Laurie H Glimcher, of Weill Cornell Medical College. \"We are hopeful that this knowledge will help bring us one step closer to shielding patients from this deadly and complex virus,\" Glimcher said. The reduction in viral load is due to the cascade of events initiated by IL-21. The investigators found that IL-21 instructs CD4 T cells to increase the amount of a small RNA molecule. That molecule, microRNA-29 (miR-29), inhibits the replication of HIV-1, limiting the amount of virus produced from infected cells. \"Our study has uncovered a potentially potent arsenal that patients have against the virus. We think IL-21 is one of those arsenals and that deploying it early will be very powerful in fighting the infection,\" said lead author Dr Stanley Adoro, a postdoctoral associate in medicine in Glimcher's lab. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications."}

Three weeks ago, the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) issued a circular asking NGOs to retrench workforce and curtail awareness activities due to paucity of funds. Public health minister Deepak Sawant said the state is aware of the hardship that the programme is going through but any fund commitment at this point looked difficult. \u201cWe have already sent a file to the Union health ministry urging them to continue funding the programme,\u201d he said. Since its inception over two decades ago, MSACS has always received 100% funding from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO). Trouble started brewing at NACO since 2013, when several international agencies started diverting funds from HIV to other diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and dengue. The NACO, now completely dependent on the central government funds, has been facing financial constraint itself. The crisis became more pronounced with the Centre slashing health budget by 17% last year. Sawant explained that NACO may be looking at 75:25 funding model, which currently exists for other national programmes such as the National Rural Health Mission. \u201cNACO is expecting us to bear 25% of the programme cost. We have told the Centre that the state is already grappling with fund crunch. So, they should grant funds till we can allocate something from the state kitty,\u201d Sawant added. MSACS has a budget of nearly Rs 150 crore that is used to sustain 142 of the 182 targeted intervention projects in the state. \u201cThe state programme caters to over eight lakh people, including female sex workers,\u201d said an NGO from Pune that has not received any funds since January. According to the MSACS circular, NGOs have to do away with 80% of the sanctioned strength of peer educators and 25% of outreach workers. On onwe hand, project director of MSACS Khushalsinh Pardeshi has assured that the core prevention activities will not suffer, but on the other hand, he admitted that NACO is behind its schedule of approving the 2015-16 plan for HIV prevention. \u201cNACO has asked state governments to contribute at least 50% of the cost,\u201d he said. Stuck in this confusion are community-based organizations, such as Malwani-based Sakhi Char Chowghi Trust that works towards prevention of HIV among transgender and fear closure now as they are completely dependent on MSACS\u2019s funds. MSACS, meanwhile, is desperately hoping that the state will expedite and release an amount of Rs 11.89 crore sanctioned by NACO, but waiting for cabinet approval. Till then, over 3000 people, many of who are HIV positive, fear loss of livelihood from July."}

Midwives or 'dayis' will be soon allowed to do HIV testing. The health ministry is set to issue a notification allowing midwives trained by the government to conduct HIV testing on pregnant women to diagnose the infection at an early stage, a source said. The idea is to make testing more accessible in order to prevent parent to child transmission of HIV or AIDS virus. \"Prevention of parent to child transmission of HIV virus is an essential part of AIDS control programme. While such testing is often available and conducted in a good hospital setting, it is not the same in rural areas and distant villages. Most of the time HIV screening does not happen even at public health centres (PHCs),\" says Nochiketa Mohanty, country program manager at Aids Healthcare Foundation India. According to the source, mid-wives will be trained by state and district AIDS control organizations to conduct rapid tests to check HIV virus. Rapid tests are cold blood tests done through finger pricking. Mid-wives will be allowed to do the tests anytime during the pregnancy prior to delivery. The health ministry is likely to issue the notification by end of this month allowing midwives to do such tests. \"At a later stage, the government may even consider allowing ayurvedacharyas or AYUSH doctors to carry on these tests,\" the source said. Experts say early screening or diagnosis in pregnant women is crucial because if one tests positive than through procedures and interventions the spread of the virus to the unborn child can be prevented. \"There is an urgent need for India to upgrade to community based testing to increase accessibility and out reach,\" Mohanty said. Estimates by National Aids Control Organization (NACO), which works under the ministry of health and family welfare, show over 22 million people were tested during 2013-14, of which 2,40,234 people were found HIV positive. This included over 12,000 pregnant women who were diagnosed with the virus. Currently, India has the third largest population of HIV infected people in the world, according to estimates of United Nations."}

The condition, itself, suffers from opinion- based 'facts' that float around in public opinion offline and, as a result, online. Today, to clear out the confusion, we filter the facts about AIDS and separate the myths from the must-know information. If you believe a mosquito bite can spread HIV and that you are insusceptible to HIV then here are 10 facts about AIDS that will change your perspective on HIV and AIDS. Facts about AIDS: Faithful sexual partner and condoms equal safe sex Condoms are considered 100 percent protection to AIDS, but the truth remains that condoms can tear and can have microscopic holes. This tends to happen if the condoms are not stored properly or they may have passed the expiry date. Tear in the condom can be attributed to strong carnal emotions. But yes, condoms and a faithful partner reduce the chances of contracting HIV. Facts about AIDS: Oral sex can cause AIDS To demystify oral sex \u2013 mouth and tongue touching the genitals. And this can cause the spread of HIV and AIDS if the partners have cuts ore sores in the mouth and the private parts. You can contract HIV through fingering too, especially if you have cuts or sores on your finger. But the risks are lower than unprotected sex; this doesn\u2019t give you a free ticket to have oral sex. The transfer of HIV is like a spy, who can slip through surveillance camera without a glitch. Facts about AIDS: You can share your toilet and cutlery with an HIV or AIDS patient The HIV virus mainly survives within the body, the virus has low chance of surviving externally, outside the body. The HIV virus can only survive on a cell, hence the virus withers away within minutes to an hour depending on the volume of the fluid. Shaking hands, sharing toilets and swimming pools should not stop you from interacting or discriminating an HIV or AIDS patient. Facts about AIDS: Your child can contract HIV if the mother is pregnant The child can contract HIV before or after birth. The virus can be transmitted during breastfeeding too. But there are drugs that can greatly reduce the chances of transferring HIV virus. But the best option recommended is a caesarean section delivery and to avoid breastfeeding. Facts about AIDS: You need to use protection even if you and your partner has HIV Unprotected sex between two partners who are infected with HIV can result in exposure to other strains of the HIV virus. It is suggested to have protected sex at all times to prevent a deadly strain of the virus. Facts about AIDS: Mosquito bite does not cause HIV There are some points to remember here: - There is not evidence to vouch that mosquitoes can spread HIV - The virus does not survive with a mosquito for along time - Lastly, insects do not inject the blood into person when they \u2018bite\u2019 Facts about AIDS: Cure for HIV Antiretroviral drugs can add life to your years and give you a normal life, but it cannot cure you completely of this parasitic virus. The HIV virus has the ability to adapt to the antiretroviral drugs, hence it is consumed with other medication. If you believe you are infected with the HIV virus in the last 72 hours, post-exposure prophylaxis or PEP drug can kill the HIV virus. Facts about AIDS: HIV does not discriminate Many of us believe we cannot contract HIV. We want to believe that the poorest of the poor are more likely to contract HIV or the rich are likely to contract it. But the fact remains that HIV does not discriminate on your bank balance, colour of your skin or country. The HIV virus will thrive on living human cell no matter your identity. Facts about AIDS: You can still spread HIV even if you\u2019re getting treatment The treatment reduces the virus in your body but the treatment does not kill the virus completely. Hence it is still advised to practice safe sex. It is possible to pass on the HIV virus to your partners and others even if you are getting treatment. Facts about AIDS: Having sex with a virgin cures AIDS This is myth; it\u2019s as good as saying that having ice cream will cure your cold. It is also believed that having sex with a disabled individual can cure HIV and AIDS. Read more Personal Health, Diet & Fitness stories on www.healthmeup.com"}

The report was submitted to civil surgeon Dr Renu Chattwal last week and she forwarded it to the principal secretary, family planning and welfare department, for further action. A 25-year-old patient from Bhaumazra tehsil in Khanna was admitted to the civil hospital on May 12, 2015, and referred to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, saying that she had hepatitis-B and low haemoglobin.

At least 15 states have reported severe shortage of free condoms, while five to six of them have announced they are out of stock, sources said. READ ALSO: Condom shortage \u2014 Jitters in Nashik ahead of Kumbh HIV fears rise over condom shortage in states Though shortages have been continuing for over a year now, many states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh have now said they have completely exhausted their stocks of condoms. Some are even short of viral load testing kits and antiretroviral medicines. Condoms are distributed free mainly among vulnerable population of female sex workers, long distance truckers, transgenders, drug users etc. Faced with a significant cut in NACO\u2019s budget, absence of global funding and part of the budget diverted to states, the Centre seems reluctant to spend more on condoms, sources say. On the other hand, in the absence of supplies or any clear directive from the Centre, many states have announced stock outs while some have reached out to global health agencies seeking intervention. \u201cThere are a number of problems. Funding, among them, is the major one but it is linked with problems in procurement, supply chain, delayed payment to companies manufacturing condoms, drugs and testing kits,\u201d says Manoj Pardeshi, general secretary, National Coalition of People Living with HIV in India, a group that works closely with HIV infected people. Maharashtra, one of the high risk states with an HIV prevalence of over 0.40%, generates an annual demand of 3.90 crore condoms under the AIDS prevention programme. While the state has been reeling under erratic supplies since December last year, several NGOs in the state have started reporting condom stock-outs over the last couple of weeks putting over 8 lakh vulnerable people, such as female sex workers, transgender, men having sex with men at risk. The situation is similar in many other states including Haryana, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Punjab. Most of these states were facing irregular supplies for over a year and which has almost come to a standstill now. Punjab State Aids Control Society additional project director Manpreet Chhatwal agrees there is a fund crunch impacting supplies. \u201cWe are working towards devising how we can generate funds without depending solely on the Centre,\u201d said Chhatwal. While states blame it on the Centre for lack of supplies, some like Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Punjab tried resolving the problem by borrowing from global organizations and other sources. However, given the huge demand, supplies could be met for just a few months. The crisis has straightaway put a population of 32 lakh at risk, who were covered under the National AIDS Control programme through targeted intervention groups, as per the estimates made by health ministry for 2011. However, public health experts say these numbers are very conservative and the real numbers are much higher. This has raised concerns among public health activists and health workers fighting the spread of deadly diseases. Parliamentarians are now likely to bring up the issue in Parliament demanding clarity from the government, sources said. Target intervention groups, which distribute condoms as part of public health programmes, have written to the State AIDS Prevention and Control Society (SACS) and other bodies, urgently seeking supplies, sources said. These shortages assume significance because India continues to battle against the infection. The UN estimates that India currently has the third largest population of HIV infected people in the world."}

This is in contrast to previous years when the hospital used to get three to four cases of babies born infected with the deadly disease, yearly. This, doctors say, proves the results of prevention of parent to child transmission are finally showing. Prevention of parent to child transmission was introduced in Goa after a significant number of new HIV cases were found to be occurring through the perinatal route\u2014 transmission of an illness from mother to child. A change was seen after new guidelines were rolled out by the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) in January 2014. Dr Wanda Viegas, senior medical officer at the antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre at GMC, said that a significant change was seen after they started implementing the new guidelines. Now, a pregnant woman who\u2019s HIV positive is immediately put on ART as opposed to the earlier method of starting treatment in the delivery room after pregnancy. Then, the mother was given a single dose of Nevirapine tablet and the baby a single dose of syrup. ART is a combination of drugs given to HIV-infected persons with CD4 count less than 350. The CD4 count is an indicator of one\u2019s immune system, and a falling CD4 count means a person infected with HIV is exposed to opportunistic infections. Normally, ART treatment for HIV patients is started only after his/her clinical investigation is conducted but Viegas said that in the case of pregnant mothers, they do not wait until the investigation is completed. \u201cThe HIV carrier who\u2019s pregnant is immediately put on ART while an investigation is conducted subsequently,\u201d she added. Since April, three pregnant women have been put on the medication. Currently, 280 children are registered with the ART centre, of which 184 children are undergoing ART. \u201cSome of the children going through ART have now attained 18-20 years of age and are doing well,\u201d she said. Doctors say that it is sad as some HIV positive children who have lost one or both parents, are entirely dependant on other members of the family who in most cases, do not care enough. A doctor says, \u201cWe have a case of a boy who lost both his parents to AIDS. His visits to the ART center are irregular as his uncle does not give him money to travel.\u201d Some children, mostly above 10 years of age, come to the centre alone to collect their monthly dose of medicines in the absence of a family member to escort them. An HIV positive person taking ART can lead a healthy life provided he/she sticks to a healthy lifestyle and adheres completely to the therapy."}

Health workers in states like Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat are bearing the brunt of the lay offs while the problem is also affecting AIDS control in Delhi, Uttarakhand and Haryana. Almost 6,000 AIDS health workers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have not received salaries for 10 months, whereas State AIDS Control Society in Maharashtra and Gujarat recently directed NGOs to curtail outreach workers by 25% and peer educators by 80%. States are blaming lack of funds of the lay offs while activists are questioning the Centre's lack of will in supporting the programme. Senior health ministry officials acknowledge the problem but point out that Rs 274 crore has been released to states in 2015-16 of which only eight states have used the funds. \"There is a lack of will within the government. Laying off of health workers is not only impacting the personnel but can be dangerous for the whole programme because these are the people who work on ground,\" says Mona Mishra, a public health expert and a social activist, who works closely with many targeted intervention groups. READ ALSO: HIV fears rise over condom shortage in states Global funding dips by 90%, may cripple war on AIDS While the lack of coordination between the Centre and states is obvious, a health ministry official said \"We are aware of the problem and therefore have written to state finance secretaries. The ministry will also soon take it up with chief secretaries.\" The impact of health workers not receiving salaries is likely to be significant as these outreach workers and educators are the ones who implement the programme on ground by creating awareness, mobilizing sex workers, transgenders and other vulnerable populations for HIV testing and treatment. These health workers are also involved in distribution of condoms and medicines. Public health experts warn laying off health workers can cripple the program and even reverse the gains of previous efforts to control the AIDS epidemic. Experts blame the lack of coordination between the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), which works under the Union health ministry, and states for delay in payments, coupled with lack of enough budgetary support and uncertainty in devolution of funds between the state and the Centre. Experts are also concerned that many of the workers who come from vulnerable communities and were trained in awareness and health programmes might slip back into risky professions. \"Many of these workers moved out of sex work and some transgenders gave up begging to help the programme. Laying off such people would mean interrupting their rehabilitation and sending them back to their old jobs again,\" says Nochiketa Mohanty, Country Program Manager, AIDS Healthcare Foundation. The national AIDS control programme is the government's largest health intervention programme. The programme run under NACO and implemented by states demonstrated an overall reduction of 57% in the annual new HIV infections among adult population from 2.74 lakh in 2000 to 1.16 lakh in 2011, according to NACO's 2013-14 annual report. However, India still continues to have the third highest number of estimated people living with HIV in the world. Not only public health experts, even senior officials in the government as well as international agencies say this is a very crucial phase and problems at this stage can offset the achievements so far. \"There is an urgent need to carry on the momentum and this certainly is not the time to sit back,\" the health ministry official said. Apart from budgetary constraints and uncertainty created by devolution of funds between the Centre and the state, the AIDS control programme has also witnessed a huge reduction in funding from various multilateral, bilateral and philanthropic donor organisations over the last three years."}

Noori was told she had tested positive for HIV, a then little known virus that was viciously attacking people around her. \u201cShe said I didn\u2019t have much time to live as they had only recently discovered the disease and there was no cure. I was asked to make my life count,\u201d said Noori, a transgender who gave up commercial sex work to help people from her community. The woman who delivered the report to Noori was Dr Suniti Solomon, whose pioneering work in HIV a year earlier had startled the medical fraternity and pushed the government to act. In 1986, Dr Solomon, then a microbiologist at Madras Medical College, and her team for the first time documented evidence of HIV infection in India. Noori was among the second batch of around 135 commercial sex workers from Chennai who were tested. \u201cShe didn\u2019t just break down science for us. She taught us to live,\u201d said Noori. For close to three decades Dr Solomon used science to save and make lives, and lost hers to cancer. She passed away at her residence in Chennai on Tuesday morning. She was 76, and is survived by her son Dr Sunil Solomon. \u201cWe lost a prolific scientist, a great teacher and a wonderful person who worked tirelessly to bring science to the people,\u201d said Dr Sundar Sundararaman, her student and later her colleague. Born into the illustrious Gaitonde family, Dr Solomon graduated from Madras Medical College. She married eminent cardio-thoracic surgeon Dr Solomon Victor. While Dr Solomon Victor focused on treating poor patients and in 1989 conceived the Rheumatic Heart Ailment project, Dr Suniti Solomon moved beyond research to set up Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education (YRG CARE), a premier HIV/AIDS care and support centre, in Chennai. \u201cMore than the virus itself, Dr Solomon was concerned about the stigma HIV positive people faced,\u201d said Dr D Dhanikachalam, head of technical support unit, Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society (TANSACS). \u201cWhen the epidemic was first discovered, people were afraid to go close to those with HIV. She felt the pain they went through and worked to fight not just the virus but the discrimination too,\u201d he said. Trained in pathology in the UK and the US, her experience covered a range of aspects linked to HIV infection, biomedical parameters to socio-economics. She also published papers extensively on HIV epidemiology, prevention, care, support and related gender issues. In 2012, Dr Suniti Solomon was given the Lifetime Achievement Award for Service on HIV/AIDS by the state-run Dr MGR Medical University here. In 2009, the ministry of science and technology conferred the \u2018National Women Bio-scientist Award\u2019 on her. In 2001, she was given a similar award for her pioneering work on HIV/AIDS by the state run-medical varsity. A fellow of National Academy of Medical Sciences (NAMS), New Delhi, she had served on several boards, including National Technical Team on Women and AIDS, Advisory Board of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative-India, the Scientific Committee of the National AIDS Research Institute Pune and the Microbicide Committee of Indian Council of Medical Research. \u201cShe was a no nonsense person with a high sense of commitment. Her work is testified through hundreds of publications and her contribution is acknowledged across the world. As a teacher, she taught over 25 batches of students in MMC,\u201d Dr Sundararaman. In an earlier interaction with TOI, Dr Solomon had commended the work Tamil Nadu had done in the field of HIV/AIDS and said the state had come a long way in screening, but the programmes had become complacent with counselling. \u201cWe have contained the infection to an extent among truckers and female sex workers. But if we become complacent there will be an increase of incidence among these as well,\u201d she had said. People who worked with her are not surprised by her prediction. \u201cShe worked tirelessly for the cause not just inside labs but outside as well. If she was concerned, there were obvious reasons,\u201d said a microbiologist, who worked closely with her in the late 90\u2019s. Dr Solomon also said it was unfortunate that despite 30 years of the HIV epidemic and the progress made, there is still no cure or effective vaccine for the infection. \u201cBut what is killing people with AIDS more is the stigma and discrimination,\u201d she had said."}

TOI reported on July 25 that many states had either laid off or stopped paying salaries to health workers involved in national AIDS control programme, posing a fresh challenge to India's largest health intervention initiative already reeling under shortages of condoms and antiretroviral medicines. While states have been blaming lack of funds for the lay-offs, senior officials in the health ministry recently intervened and assured the states of enough funds for the national AIDS control programme, sources said. Health workers, mainly from vulnerable communities like sex workers and transgenders, also met senior officials in the ministry earlier this week. The ministry has also initiated additional procurement of condoms and medicines to meet the shortage, an official said. The move is significant as it was feared that laying off health workers would impact the implementation of the programme on the ground. Besides creating awareness, mobilizing sex workers, transgenders and other vulnerable populations for HIV testing and treatment, these health workers are also involved in distribution of condoms and medicines. However, sources say, the problem still persists in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Almost 6,000 AIDS health workers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have not received salaries for 10 months.

Devi\u2019s move to Chennai, in many ways, parallels the anti-HIV/AIDS movement in which Dr Suniti Solomon played a key role. Her passing away on Tuesday is an opportunity for many stakeholders working in health and HIV to introspect on the nearly three decades of work. It was not just in detection \u2013 Suniti Solomon has been credited with identifying that HIV had indeed entered India in 1986 \u2014 but also in prevention that Tamil Nadu led from the front, bringing in government as well as international action, creating a ripple effect among civil society organizations and communities.

The dynamics of the HIV programme in the state has seen a sea change in recent times, however. Two key donors \u2014 USAID and BMGF \u2014 phased out their intervention among high-risk groups from 2010 and, in addition to handing over to the state, began to focus on documentation and sharing of \u201cbest practices\u201d while transferring the onus of action onto communities. For such a successful journey, the concern now is that, progress made by Tamil Nadu must not be lost. A close look at recent district-level data shows cause for worry. There are several districts that show high-prevalence in the general population and an upward trend since 2010. Erode, Salem and Trichy districts show over 1% prevalence in the general population. The prevalence in several other districts, such as Namakkal and Tiruvarur, are above the state and national average and it\u2019s climbing. With Kanyakumari being a new entrant into this category. Is there a reversal in a journey that has been so successful? It is not just the prevalence in general population that is seeing a reversal; it is also the dynamics of \u201chigh-risk groups\u201d \u2013 that had seen much change over the years \u2013 which is of concern. For instance, Tamil nadu was the first state to set up a transgender welfare board, the first to provide separate entitlements for them, offer sex reassignment surgeries, besides visible political engagement. Here too, progress seems to be ebbing. Communities don\u2019t seem have developed the capacity to take over programme interventions. Consolidation has not happened and there is restlessness over withdrawal of international donors in several regions. With the withdrawal of donors, centres that were nodal points for communities to engage with one another were also handed over or shut down. The peer education and communities\u2019 ability to protect themselves from high-risk behaviour relied heavily on drop-in centres. Now, there are only 38 drop-in centres across Tamil Nadu for counselling or rallying communities, especially those living with HIV. This limits opportunities to meet and discuss HIV. In the euphoria of effective prevention, these are some warning signals that must not be ignored. It is at this critical point of need to consolidate that Tamil Nadu is placed. Yes, it is still positive that Devi at the traffic signal came to Chennai looking for a better life. Only, having moved here, she should not have been begging on the streets. The state that came together for nearly three decades of an internationally shared success story, needs to pull together to finish the task on and. It is time to ensure that years of hard work are not undone. It is also time for Devi to move on, not to the next vehicle, but towards a better life. It is time \u2014 as the slogan in HIV/AIDS prevention goes \u2014 to get to zero. (The author is a development communication professional who has worked on HIV/AIDS prevention)"}

His dream has a mission too - Akshay wants to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS, urging support for people living with it. He said people living with HIV, especially those in rural areas, face a lot of problems in society which needs to be eradicated. He is training for the climb, and is working on his physical and mental fitness. Adjusting the body to low temperatures for 60-70 days is a big challenge. He has finished a 30-day training in the Gangotri Hills region in Uttarkashi (lower Himalayas) under the guidance of the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering. He has also completed the 45-day rope climbing training at Badami under the General Thimmaiah National Adventure and Sports Academy. Over the past three years, Akshay has been involved in adventure activities. He was also part of the rescue operations in the Uttarakhand tragedy a few months ago. The dream of climbing the Everest took shape when he met two mountaineers, Arjun Vajpayee and Krishna, during these rescue operations. These two youths had successfully climbed the Everest. The Everest climb is a costly %affair. Deshpande needs around %Rs 30 lakh for it. \"I'm looking for sponsors and hoping crowdfunding and public donations will help me on my mission,\" he told TOI."}

Naik launched the mobile app in Goa at a function to celebrate International Youth Day at the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee stadium, Taleigao, in the presence of chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar, deputy chief minister Francis D\u2019Souza, sports and youth affairs minister Ramesh Tawadkar and others. Dubbed \u2018Help\u2019 \u2014 HIV education and link to prevention\u2014 the app ensures confidentiality and can be downloaded from the App Store and Google Play. It is expected to reach over 11crore people across rural and urban India. Naik said that the government has an aggressive intervention programme to combat HIV/AIDS. The unique feature of the anti-HIV programme is that it has always kept the marginalized and high-risk groups as the focus areas. Over 15,000 integrated counselling and testing centres are now functional across the country. Over 410 anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres provide treatment to about 7.4 lakh HIV patients in India. Naik said that since Goa is a popular tourist destination, it needs a robust strategy. This is an important occasion to reiterate that our prevention service reaches every person. Parsekar said that of the 120 crore people in India, 50% are below the age of 25 and that is why, it is imperative to focus on issues affecting the youth and to understand the challenges they face. Though HIV has declined in Goa in recent years, the government wants to take it to zero level and also do away with the stigma attached to it. Another highlight of the function is the testimonies given by two teenagers from Bengaluru. Babu Seenappa, 14, and Manik Prabhu, 16, both represented India in the international children\u2019s games in Netherlands in June this year. Both are HIV positive and reside at Sneha Care Home, Bengaluru. Seenappa was born with HIV but now competes in 5km and 10km races. Prabhu runs 100m and relays. Speaking about his participation in an international competition, Babu said it was a proud moment for him. \u201cHIV did not stop me and will never stop me from doing anything. Many of my friends have been denied admissions to schools because of their HIV status but we cannot spread infection through normal contact.

A classic example is that of Keshava (name changed). The 42-year-old has been an HIV positive since 2004 and initially he was in a bad condition. Doctors too had given up on him. But today, Keshava is leading a dignified life. He could walk over 3km a day without any support. \"I did not think I could live. It's only because of self-confidence and moral support that I could survive,\" says Keshava. Initially, he did not take treatment due to financial constraints. He owned a petty shop to sustain his family. In 2011, his health deteriorated and he was bedridden, unable to even move his hands. Doctors sent him back home losing all hope, he added. His mother Sathyavathi says she owes it all to the Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement (SVYM). \"If my son is alive, it's only because of SVYM and its volunteers' moral support,\" she says. Despite his failing health, he did small jobs like starting a mobile recharge shop to support his family. Thanks to the palliative care facility of SVYM, the bedridden patients and their families get support. The facility, apart from taking care of patients, also helps their family members to avail governmental benefits. \"Now, I am receiving widow pension and my son is getting pension from the government. Palliative care volunteers helped me get these benefits,\" said Sathyavathi. The CD4 count in HIV patients should be above 350 but if the count falls below that, patients may become bedridden and the risks are very high, says district AIDS controller Dr T Raghu Kumar. Keshava had CD4 count below 50 when palliative care volunteers visited him in 2012. Like him, more than 300 bedridden needy patients have availed palliative care. Today, some of them are leading a dignified life. \"The goal is to improve the quality of life for patients and their families. The need of palliative care is essential in terminal and chronic diseases as they are incurable and result in physical, psychological, socio-economic strain to individuals and their families,\" says palliative care volunteer Dr Deepak Murthy. The palliative care facility has served 345 bedridden patients suffering from cancer, paralysis, spinal cord injury, severe neurological disorders, hypertension, gangrene, kidney failure, cerebral palsy and other illnesses since 2011. Initially, 88 patients were inducted into the programme. Palliative care operates with a team approach consisting of doctors, nurses, counsellors, social workers and volunteers visiting each patient's home and providing a holistic care for patients to improve the quality of life by using an array of skills at their doorstep."}

Having spoken to Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) officials for months now, project directors of the affected projects have now decided to get in touch with National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) to resolve the issue. With international funds drying up, NACO had decided to share the expenses on AIDS prevention and awareness with the state governments since the beginning of the current financial year. However, clear instructions about the proportion of the funds to be borne by NACO and the state was not communicated. This has meant that the NGOs have received no funds for the projects at all for at least five months. Some of the project directors from the region met health secretary Sujata Sounik and MSACS project director Khushalsingh Pardesi on Tuesday. These included Anand Chandrani of Sarathi Trust, Rajabhau Jodh from Manav Vikas Sanstha, Dr Raghunath Wadekar from Amravati\u2019s RSTM Bahuddeshiya Sanstha and Devendra Kshirsagar of Sahyadri Foundation. \u201cThe officials told us that they were aware of the problems we were facing and that they were not in a position to help.

Meanwhile, the expenses made by every NGO are being sent to MSACS and forwarded to NACO every month to which no response has been received from the central agency yet. The funds he is talking about amount to Rs11crore that MSACS is due to get from NACO at the end of this month. A huge chunk of this money is supposed to go towards the pending bills of medicines, half of it is promised to be paid to the staff of the projects and the remaining would go towards the continuity of the projects. \u201cThere are 156 NGOs working in the state, each with around 30 staffers.

Other activists are worried that this will weaken the country\u2019s AIDS control programme. \u201cWork done on the ground level by our workers cannot be done by the government on its own.

However, the ban on HIV-positive foreigners who are looking to work in Singapore or accompanying a child studying here and intend to stay for a long period is still in place. The ban on short-term HIV-positive visitors was lifted on April 1, but it stays on long-term visitors, The Straits Times reported on Monday. \"The policy on the repatriation and permanent blacklisting of HIV-positive foreigners was recommended in the late 1980s when the disease was new, fatal and no effective treatment was available,\" a ministry of health spokesman was quoted as saying by the daily. The short-term ban was lifted \"given the current context with more than 5,000 Singapore residents living with HIV and the availability of effective treatment for the diseases.\" \"Lifting the short-term travel restrictions... poses very low additional risk of HIV transmission to the local population,\" the spokesman said. However, the public health risk posed by long-stayers is not insignificant, hence the restriction on long-term visits has been retained. The Singapore rule is similar to immigration laws in other countries like Australia and New Zealand, he added. Foreigners in Singapore, excluding permanent residents and spouses of Singaporeans, found to be HIV-positive will be deported and put on a permanent blacklist. A spokesman for advocacy group 'Action for Aids' has welcomed the change, but said the restrictions should also be lifted for long-term visitors. \"People living with HIV or Aids are not criminals and should not be banned from entering the country. \"(They) can and should be able to have fulfilling and rewarding lives, with loving relationships and be integrated as part of the community.

But for PositiveSaathi.com it is no mean feat. Seven years ago, when city-based Regional Transport Office inspector Anil Valiv launched this matrimonial website dedicated to matchmaking of HIV-positive people, he never thought his initiative would get such a huge response. \"We do not have the resources to follow up on our registered users, but we conservatively estimate that at least 500 marriages have been fixed among our users. The number can even be double of that,\" Valiv said. Valiv was posted in Latur in 2006 when he heard about an HIV positive man looking for a bride and thought of starting a website that connects HIV positive people. Operating out of a small office in Mangalwar Peth, PositiveSaathi.com has emerged as a relative success story. It registers bride and groom-seekers for free, regularly organises matrimonial meets and has quite a few success stories to its credit. One such matrimonial meet was held in Mumbai on Saturday in association with the State AIDS Control Society. \"We have had to convince potential users that we verify the users' background regularly, and that their identities shall be secured to all possible extents,\" Valiv said. Among the first marriages the website forged was that of an HIV-positive boy from Hyderabad, who was working in Singapore, with a London-based Indian girl who had divorced her husband after she found she had contracted the infection from him. She also had a daughter. Both had registered themselves on the website and after meeting and talking to each other, they decided to tie the knot. Administrators of the website say that the matrimonial process is fairly arduous and one that requires them to stay alert. There are many fake profiles and profiles of married people too, which is why they have to frequently revisit their databases and carry out background checks of users. \"Another problem is the male-to-female registration ratio on our website as well as in our matrimonial meets is heavily skewed. For every 10 male registrations, only about two to three women register. Also, after the potential bride and groom meet through the website or via the meetings, aspects like financial condition, caste, creed, and religion do come up,\" he said. The success stories more than make up for the hassles. \"In 2012, we had organised a similar matrimonial meet for HIV-positive persons in Pune, and to our surprise, five couples who met that day went to a registrar and got married,\" one of the website administrators said. Then there was the case of a 34-year-old HIV-positive woman from Pune who was encouraged by her uncles to get married again after her divorce. She came to know about our website from her doctor. Her profile was soon uploaded on the website where she connected with a man from Mumbai. They got married two years ago. The website's administrators say the website can possibly achieve much more if there is state support. \"We do not really receive much support from the state government. In fact, we collaborated with the state AIDS control society for the first time during our Mumbai meet. To get people to register on our website, we try to engage various non-governmental organisations, who have been working in the field of HIV-AIDS prevention. Their participation is very crucial for our venture to work,\" said Valiv."}

This came to light during a media sensitization workshop in Shimla wherein HIV positive people shared life experiences. The workshop was organized by Mamta Health Institute for Mother and Child, New Delhi, in collaboration with Himachal Pradesh State AIDS Control Society and Himachal Pradesh Voluntary Health Association. Shreshtha (name changed), a woman from Kangra district, was thrown out of her house by her in-laws on coming to know about her HIV status. This despite the fact that she was infected by her husband, a truck driver and was forced to live in misery along with her two children. However, she was lucky to get help of village panchayats and a local NGO. Today, she is heading an organization that works in association with panchayati raj institutions to create awareness about HIV positive people. In 2011, she was also awarded the best social worker award. Bhago (name changed), another HIV positive woman from Kangra district, was passed on the infection by her husband. However, the damage catapult as by the time she came to know about her being HIV positive, she had three children from the marriage. She earns her livelihood by working as daily wager and fear of being stigmatized by the society is not letting her reveal her status. Women alone are not the ones to suffer. Sohan Lal (name changed) from Bilaspur was detected with HIV in 1990, but till date he has not revealed his being HIV positive to his relatives and villagers as he fears to he will be ostracized once he reveals the truth. \"I could reveal this to my family members only after five years,\" he added. Himachal Pradesh health director Dr D S Gurung said that 30 NGOs are working for HIV positive people in the state. He said drug abuse is increasing in border areas of the state and that is leading increasing cases of HIV too. He said that recently a meeting was held in which a proposal to provide pension to HIV positive people and bus passes for free travel for treatment was discussed too. A health official said that female sex workers are being provided vocation training and 550 have already been included under livelihood training. Vocation training to them would be provided at Industrial Training Institutes of Nahan, kala Amb, Solan, Bilaspur, Mandi, Shimla, Nalagrh and Baddi. Himachal's challenge Though Himachal Pradesh falls under the category of low prevalent state where the infection rate among the adult HIV prevalence is 0.17% with total count of positive persons at 8,091, efforts are on to nail down the causes that are resulting in spread of HIV/AIDS. As unprotected sex contributes 88% in the spread of HIV/AIDS, efforts are being made to rehabilitate female sex workers operating in the state. Official sources informed that around 10,000 female sex workers are operating in Himachal Pradesh, of which around 6,900 are working with the NGOs for their rehabilitation."}

Proteins called broadly neutralising antibodies (bNAbs) are a promising key to the prevention of infection by HIV , the virus that causes AIDS. The bNAbs have been found in blood samples from some HIV patients whose immune systems can naturally control the infection. These antibodies may protect a patient's healthy cells by recognising a protein called the envelope spike, present on the surface of all HIV strains and inhibiting, or neutralising, the effects of the virus. Researchers at the California Institute of Technology have discovered that one particular bNAb may be able to recognise this signature protein, even as it takes on different conformations during infection -making it easier to detect and neutralise the viruses in an infected patient.

Antiretroviral treatments are not vaccines; they simply keep HIV in check in low levels in the body. While it could be decades before an ERManI-based treatment can be prescribed for HIV-1 patients, these results provide a strong path for future research involving human cells, and later, clinical tests. The next steps will be to test if HIV resistance can be promoted by increasing ERManI levels, said Zheng, who worked on the study with scientists from the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the University of Georgia. Most viruses have viral envelopes, or protective skins, that comprise similar building blocks of the host the pathogens are trying to infect. On the surface of the envelope, there are viral glycoproteins, known as Env spikes, which act as valets, leading viruses to binding sites that allow infections to spread at the molecular level. They serve as a key of sorts that gives viruses entry into the host to begin spreading. Zheng's lab was the first to show that HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein biosynthesis can be specifically inhibited by ERManI, which is a host enzyme to add sugars to proteins. By identifying ERManI as the target that slows the spread of HIV-1, the team showed a target in which future natural therapies can be developed. More than 1.2 million people in the US have HIV. In China, doctors diagnosed 104,000 new cases of HIV/AIDS in 2014. The number of infections is rising, though overall the country still has a low rate of infection. Currently, there is no cure for HIV-1; once patients have it, they have it for life. While there are antiretroviral therapies available, they can only prolong life, albeit dramatically, but they cannot cure the disease. Current drug treatments have to be taken for a lifetime, which causes side effects and many other issues, Zheng said. \"We see a way to treat this disease by helping the body protect itself,\" he said. The study was published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry."}

The app, first of its kind in India, is based on various international models. The app would provide all kinds of information on AIDS, which is not easily available otherwise. For instance, it will provide information of HIV testing centres in the locality, information on availability of free testing kits and medicines etc. The app, called HELP (HIV Education and Linkage to Prevention), will also prompt users to access HIV testing from the nearest centre free of cost. The idea is to bridge the awareness and accessibility gap through digital intervention and encourage youth to know their HIV status. The move will also help the government to keep a count on the incidence and prevalence of HIV cases, which is currently a major area of contention. The national AIDS control programme is the government's largest health intervention programme. The programme, run under NACO and implemented by states, demonstrated an overall reduction of 57 per cent in the annual new HIV infections among adult population from 2.74 lakh in 2000 to 1.16 lakh in 2011, according to NACO's 2013-14 annual report. However, the facts were questioned by many international agencies, which said a lot of people in India are unaware of their HIV status. According to the United Nations, India has the third highest number of estimated people living with HIV in the world. \"To start with, it will provide some basic information but slowly we will ramp it up to include detailed information and education as well as various services,\" an official said. AIDS Healthcare Foundation, an international agency which works in the area, is working with the government to expand the use of the app across the country. AHF has also funded the app, while NACO is taking care of the operations and implementation part. According to the official, the app will ensure confidentiality and can currently be operated in two languages - English and Hindi. The health ministry is expecting to reach more than 11 crore people across urban and rural geographies through the app. The government is also planning to launch promotional advertisements for the app on television and radio. Besides, it will also use social media and you tube to popularize it. \"Once the app is popular among the youth, we will update it to include more information,\" the official said adding in future it can also be used to spread awareness about many other diseases and preventive healthcare measures. \"There is a gap between the estimated number of people living with HIV and those who have tested and know their status. It is critical that people know their HIV status early so that they can opt for treatment,\" he said."}

However, there are divergent views on whether this is due to the campaign or growing hygiene levels. Demand analysis for the past few months conducted by Pranay Impex, a domestic manufacturer of household cleaning aids in 17 cities, claims that the demand for cleaning product sale have risen by 30% in Punjab since the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, thereby hinting that the problem lies with the local bodies that have failed in keeping the surroundings clean. \"People of Punjab are spending substantially in maintaining cleanliness and hygiene of their houses. The demand for brooms, toilet brushes and scrubbers are on a constant rise even in the interiors of Punjab. Demand for these products has almost doubled in the last 1 year,\" said Praveen Khandelwal, director of Pranay Impex. \"People of the state are buying more scrubbers, brooms and toilet brushes and it is the local bodies that have failed in their duty to keep the cities clean.

However, Sushil Jain of Roop Enterprises, which deals in cleaning liquids in Punjab, said the sector itself is growing and it may not necessarily due to the campaign. \"Due to general awareness about hygiene and increasing paying capacity of people, there has been year-on-year growth,\" he insisted. Even though companies like Reckitt India have promised to spend Rs 100 crore in the next five years for creating awareness about the importance of hygiene and sanitation, reaching out to 2,000 villages in a year, local traders rue that there haven't been any steps to incentivize use of cleanliness products. As many as seven of the 17 cities in Punjab are ranked at the bottom 100 of the 476 cities in the country in the cleanliness survey under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, and Hoshiarpur is the dirtiest (447) of these, followed by Malerkotla (431) and Barnala (439). The other four are Amritsar (430), Abohar (420), Muktsar (384) and Ludhiana (381).

These NGOs have not been getting any funds to run their projects since January this year. The money, coming from the union government, is supposed to be directed through the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS).

While this has not happened, even salaries of the staff working under the MSACS have not been paid for September. \u201cThe meeting on Saturday was a regular review meet in which NGOs are expected to share data and experiences about their monthly activities.

She admitted that all eight NGOs from the district kept away from the meeting. Similar meetings took place in all the districts of the state last week. Only 10-15 of the 156 NGOs attended them, most choosing to boycott it. As the salaries of staffers of Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres, Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTC) and DAPCU did not come for the month of September, they have stopped sending monthly reports they send to MSACS. These reports consist of information about the number of medicines taken by the HIV positive people in the district, stock of the medicines available at the centre and people walking in for getting tested for STIS, among other data. \u201cWe have tried several democratic ways of getting the attention of the authorities to our problems.

I can safely call myself a loyal wife. However, last year I went to a offsite with my colleagues and I ended up having a one night stand with the hotel manager. Just recently I have been detected with a sexually transmitted disease. I have been avoiding sex with my husband ever since but I don't know for how long I can continue like this without revealing to him the real reason. Please help me the way forward. \u200b- By Anonymous\u200b Answer by Dr Deepak Raheja: Your situation is definitely complex and I understand the emotional turmoil within you is furthering it. I strongly recommend that you need to put your emotions on the back burner for a little while and try to get an objective perspective into this situation. Kindly acknowledge the fact that you withheld information from your husband and also chose to have a one night stand for your whimsical temporary gratification. However, it seems quiet evident that you do not do this in a pattern and also you do not have any emotional strings attached to this isolated event and gave in to a weak moment. Secondly, you cannot erase the past. So, its deemed fit that you accept and face the reality and have an honest sit down conversation with yourself evaluating the bond you have with your husband and how he would react to an honest submission by you explaining the situation to him. This will help you deal with your own guilt and you shall be able to face yourself again. One error on your part in no way defines all of you and having the grace and the courage to accept your mistake shall speak volumes about the strength of your character and help you in rebuilding the trust in your relationship. In case you feel he may not be able to handle this and the revelation may have far reaching lasting scars you may decide to bury the dead.This was a mistake and lets accept it for one. Don\u2019t waste time, rush to a Gynecologist who are usually well versed and trained to diagnose and treat STD in women. You owe a sincere apology to your husband and you could do this by making appropriate actions and choices in the now and the future is something you must consider and focus on. You must put in your best efforts to nurture the emotional bond with him.

Patients with HIV are encouraged to participate in regular checkups to keep track of their health. In high resource settings, devices known as flow cytometers complete the tests by analysing the blood. Flow cytometers, however, are bulky machines that run on electricity. The machines also cost upwards of USD 50,000. \"Flow cytometers are not practical for areas with limited resources like Africa or Mexico,\" said Thomas Boland, a professor of metallurgical, materials and biomedical engineering at University of Texas at El Paso who created a less expensive, battery-powered health monitoring tool for use in third world countries. The portable device works by helping clinicians count the number of CD4 cells - cells that are attacked by HIV - in the body. After drawing a patient's blood, clinicians mix in magnetic microscale beads that latch on to CD4 cells in the blood. The mixture is then placed in an inkjet printer that's been modified to print out cells instead of ink. Rather than printing vertically onto a sheet of paper, the cells are shot out horizontally onto a magnetised microscopic slide. CD4 cells in the blood automatically attach to the slide, while other cells that do not need to be counted dribble down into an excess container. Doctors can then look at the slide through a microscope to count the number of CD4 cells on it. That number is inserted into an equation that calculates the total number of CD4 cells in the individual's body. The procedure takes as little as 20 minutes, resulting in ultra-quick results. Boland hopes his new printer will help doctors and patients in low-resource settings who don't have access to flow cytometers. The next step in the process is to license the technology to a company that is willing to help get it on the market. Several doctors in Mexico have already expressed interest in the device, Boland said."}

MSACS authorities have also acknowledged this but said it was due to unavoidable, bureaucratic reasons that the funds were delayed. Disgruntled by the delay in getting funds, some of the project directors from the city had written about their problems to the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO). In response, the organization, which was an autonomous entity under the union ministry of health and family welfare until a year ago, forwarded them a letter dated July 24, 2015. This letter clearly states that a total amount of Rs274.52 crores had been released to the SACS. This would come to a sum of around Rs11 crore for each society across the country. During the troubled times over the last couple of months, as the NGOs sought different ways to protest the delay in disbursement of funds, MSACS officials had acknowledged having received the funds. When TOI had spoken with Dr MS Diggikar, joint director, care, support and treatment (CST) department of MSACS, he had said that the process of release of funds was almost complete and they may be expected in the next week. Other officials had also said that the problem was red-tape rather than lack of funds. \u201cEarlier, NACO was an independent body under the health ministry.

Boehringer did not respond to a query sent out by TOI.\u201cThe applicant (Boehringer) did not respond to the pre-grant opposition and also did not appear at the hearing fixed for the same on September 15, 2015,\u201d legal sources told TOI. N R Meena, deputy controller of Patents & Designs, said in the order, a copy of which was accessed by TOI, since the applicant did not appear in the hearing fixed under section 25(1) before the controller, and no arguments were offered to rebut the objections raised in the FER (first examination report), and by the opponent, therefore the application for grant of patent is refused."}

This was to protest non-payment of their salaries in the last couple of months. Earlier this week, the workers met officials who threatened workers with strict action if they did not return to work soon. The protesting staffers include those who work for Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTCs), blood banks, STI clinics, ART centres and District AIDS Prevention And Control Units (DAPCU). Not only have their salaries not been paid for past two-three months, but also the hikes they were given in 2013 still have not been made effective. On Monday, they met the finance director of MSACS Sunil Bhosale who assured them salaries would be paid as soon as the necessary funds are forwarded from National AIDS Control Society (NACO) and state government. On Tuesday, the society warned the staffers that strict action would be taken against them under Maharashtra Essential Services and Maintenance (MESMA) Act if they did not stop the non-cooperation movement. \u201cMESMA can only be used on us if our actions put the patients in trouble. We have not stopped giving any services, only withheld the reports we are supposed to send to MSACS,\u201d said president of Maharashtra Rajya AIDS Niyantran Karmachari Sanghatana. He added the decision on returning to work will only be taken when all staffers agree to it. Bhosale told the staffers that a sum of Rs104 crore was earmarked by the state in the annual budget for MSACS. \u201cOnly Rs11.50 crore has been sent by NACO which has already been used in paying the salaries. Another Rs20 crore has been forwarded to the state government by NACO that would come to the society after being cleared by the finance and planning departments, which, too, will be just enough to pay salaries,\u201d he said. The finance director also said some of the money has to be given to NGOs working alongside MSACS. \u201cThe salaries of MSACS staffers didn\u2019t come through only for two months. We have not got any funds since nine months. Yet, the society doesn\u2019t seem too worried about us or our families, or even the fact that many NGOs are ready to give up the projects,\u201d said Hemlata Lohave from Red Cross Society whose organization handles projects related to HIV-AIDS prevention among commercial sex workers."}

One would expect illustrations of princes to jump out of the pages of her book. Instead, there are handmade drawings of her grandmother. Since her mother's death, Jean, who has tested HIV positive, is being looked after by her grandmother. The biggest concern for families like hers is how to break the news to a child about his/her HIV status. This concern prompted Fundacion VIHDA to come up with a programme for diagnostic disclosure of HIV to children and to prepare them for their life ahead. Two years since, 15 children, having an average age of 10 to 12 years, have completed the programme. Globally, 3.2 million children, under the age of 15, were living with HIV in 2013, according to UNAIDS. They comprised 9.1% of all people living with HIV. 240,000 children worldwide acquired HIV in 2013: one new infection every two minutes. \"A significant number of kids in Ecuador acquire the HIV virus from their mothers who may not have been able to receive treatment on time to prevent transmission to the child. As kids grow up, they start asking questions. They know how to read signs at hospitals and labels on flasks. It is important for the child to know that he is not sick and that he has rights,\" says clinical psychologist Dr. Claudia Zambrano, one of the founding members of Fundacion VIHDA. Zambrano and her team have individual sessions, every fortnight, for children living with HIV that approach the clinic. A specific action plan is drawn up based on the personal situation of every child. \"We work with the child's personal history, their specific life circumstances and his/her family, in order to address their needs. The children are taught about wholesome health, just like in school. They are given a general idea about medical conditions, concepts like viral load (amount of HIV in a blood sample), drugs and how they react in the body,\" says Zambrano.Group sessions are held with peers after a couple of months so the child gets a support network. Nine-year-old Valentina had stumped a bunch of paramedics at her school when she told them that she had HIV. She had learnt of her diagnosis from her aunt and did not confide in her friends. But when the paramedics started quizzing students about their allergies and medical conditions, Valentina thought it was okay to tell. \"Valentina was nervous when the paramedics spoke to her teachers. I went over to her school and met the authorities. We spoke to Valentina and strengthened the feeling that there was nothing wrong with her,\" said Zambrano. After that episode at school, things changed as Valentina's teachers and principal were more open to the topic. Valentina continued two years more in the same school and is now in college. She comes regularly to the Fundacion VIHDA clinic and discusses updates in her life as a teenager, occasionally attending some of the group sessions held for younger kids living with HIV. The diagnostic disclosure programme has no fixed duration. \"Kids come to us at different stages. Some of them approach us in crisis after getting to know of their diagnosis in difficult situations. In such cases, we have to work on repair and stress on the fact that although the HIV status is an integral aspect of the child's life, it does not define him as a person. We seek family support and also counsel families on tackling the situation,\" says a member of the psychological counselling team at Fundacion VIHDA. Children in crisis are burdened with a lot of questions and anxieties. They know they have greater physical restrictions than other kids their age. Some of them fear they would die like their mother did. Others are worried that they would get sick often and may not have money to pay for medication in future. \"Children are taught to keep information about their health situation private and not disclose it to any of their friends or acquaintances. But there have been situations where classmates or teachers have found out and started discriminating against them. In such cases, parents or grandparents are encouraged to deal with the situation firmly as we have laws against discrimination of people living with HIV. The child may change schools to overcome discrimination. They work very hard to regain self-esteem and overcome that episode,\" says Zambrano. At Enrique Sotomayor, the largest maternity hospital in Guayaquil where 20% of Ecuador's children are born, a team headed by Dr. Mercedes Ortiz have been fighting to bring down the number of mother-to-child transmissions, despite scarce resources and cultural stigma against HIV. \"The risk of transmission from mother-to-child can occur during pregnancy, breastfeeding or birth. We provide information to all our female patients on why it's important to get tested for HIV and how to prevent transmission of the virus to their babies,\" says Ortiz. From the moment of diagnosis, antiretroviral (ARV) medication has to be administered to the pregnant woman and it has to continue indefinitely. Prior to the birth of the child, these ARVs reduce the amount of virus in the bloodstream and prevent transmission from mother-to-child. On birth, babies must be given infant antiretrovirals during the first month of their life and they have to remain under medical observation till they are 18.

The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has approved Genvoya \u2014 a fixed-dose combination tablet containing elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide \u2014 as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and paediatric patients aged 12 and above. READ ALSO: New drug offers potential to keep HIV at bay indefinitely Though the drug is currently not available in India, experts say approval in the US is a major breakthrough and may trigger trials for the medicine in India, which has the third highest number of HIV-infected people in the world. Currently, India has over 20 lakh people living with HIV, while there are around 1.5 lakh children infected with the virus. Though India demonstrated an overall reduction of 57% in the annual new HIV infections among adults, it still witnesses around 1.2 lakh new infections and 1.5 lakh AIDS-related deaths every year. \u201cToday\u2019s approval of a fixed dose combination containing a new form of tenofovir provides another effective, once-daily, complete regimen for patients with HIV-1 infection,\u201d said Edward Cox, director of the Office of Antimicrobial Products at USFDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. According to USFDA, Genvoya contains a new form of tenofovir that has not been previously approved. This new form provides lower levels of drug in the bloodstream, but higher levels within the cells, where HIV-1 replicates. \u201cIt was developed to help reduce some drug side effects,\u201d the regulator said. READ ALSO: Natural defence against HIV discovered According to USFDA, the new drug also appears to be associated with less kidney toxicity and decreases in bone density than previously approved tenofovir-containing regimens based on laboratory measures. The American regulator has approved the medicine for children weighing at least 35 kilograms (77 pounds) who have never taken HIV therapy and HIV-infected adults whose HIV-1 virus is currently suppressed. The drug, not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment, will also carry a \u2018Boxed Warning\u2019 alerting patients and healthcare providers that the drug can cause a buildup of lactic acid in the blood and severe liver problems, both of which can be fatal. The \u2018Boxed Warning\u2019 also states that Genvoya is not approved to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection. The drug should not be prescribed with other antiretroviral products as it may have drug interactions with a number of other commonly used medications."}

In a function organized by the Coimbatore District HIV Ullor Nala Sangam, a set of new clothes and a box of sweets were distributed to around 120 children who have either been infected or affected by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Saris and sweets were also distributed to 80 women, who were widowed and infected with the virus.

Known as a silent killer, about 15 cases of the HIV-2 strain have been detected in Goa in the last two years. As with HIV-1, the mode of transmissions of HIV-2 is through sex and from mother-to-child during pregnancy. The medication for both the strains differ. Confirming the developments of the HIV-2 strain, Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, anti-retroviral therapy centre\u2019s (ART) senior medical officer, Dr Vanda Viegas said, \u201cIt is a worrying factor as the detection of HIV-2 is not as easy as HIV-1. The strain can remain undetected in the body for five-six years.\u201d \u201cHIV-2 virus will not cause any harm to the person for few years, but after that the decline in the health of the carrier is steady,\u201d Viegas said. If a person doesn\u2019t get treatment on time, she said, early death is imminent. Asked what could have triggered the HIV-2 cases in the state, Viegas said it cannot be pinpointed without thorough research, and that the new cases have been reported to the higher authorities. Of the 15 HIV-2 cases detected, Viegas said ten were migrants including a South Indian couple. Quite a few cases of HIV-2 strain have been detected in some states in South India. She said the South Indian couple was put on a therapy \u2013 protease inhibitors, a type of antiviral drug, and though initially showed to be responding, they stopped visiting ART centre on the scheduled dates. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether they are dead or alive,\u201d she added. In fact, this is a typical problem faced by the ART centre as some of the patients registered for treatment don\u2019t show up after the first few visits. The problem is more so with migrants who disappear after the first few visits. The officials at the ART centre find it difficult to locate them as they lack proper addresses."}

In fact, doctors and NGOs dealing with HIV+ adolescents are faced with new problems, such as how to explain and make HIV-affected children understand that they need to lead a controlled life as they become adults. That they will not be able to enjoy life on par with their counterparts. Many of them think \u201cbeing HIV\u201d means they will die soon and are in a hurry to live life to the fullest extent such as partying hard or being in a relationship. Dr Vanda Viegas, senior medical officer at ART center located in Goa medical college (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, said though they have had good results with children, who were put on ART since the centre started in the year 2005, they are now posed with more complex problems. \u201cThe problem is getting more complicated as most are orphans brought up in the orphanages and are now on their own,\u201d she said. They have similar urges and desires like other adolescents of their age, but, the only difference is that they have a deadly ailment. There is also a tendency among HIV-positive children to give up education once they learn about their disease. \u201cThey want to freak out and do everything possible before death catches up with them,\u201d said Viegas. Though some may be keen to do higher studies, she said they might not excel for the disease is likely to affect their IQ. Few are into college education, nonetheless. Peter Borges, secretary, Positive People, an NGO working for people afflicted with HIV/AIDS, said life for such children is not easy. Last week, a three-day workshop was held in Valpoi for HIV children,, who were informed about their ailment and were counselled on various aspects. They were also informed about various career options and how to go about it, and also given tips on stress management. A counsellor, who has been counselling HIV patients, for a while, said counselling children with HIV is a tough job. Children with no parents or parents or a guardian going astray are high once they grasp the magnitude of their disease fully. \u201cThey want to be like other youth. Though we do warn them about perils of their action, we suspect some get into relationship without revealing to their partners about their ailment,\u201d he said. Viegas said, in recent times, she has come across three-four cases wherein relatives of HIV-positive girls got them married outside Goa. \u201cIn none of the cases, the groom or his family was informed about the HIV status of the bride,\u201d she pointed out. The end result has been tragic. After marriage, the girls stopped taking ART to hide the disease, and consequently progression of HIV virus in them was faster. \u201cThey wanted to hide their ailment from their families, but, the arrangement didn\u2019t work. They were thrown out by their respective families,\u201d she pointed out. When some reported back at the ART center, they were in stage four, with full blown AIDS."}

Here is an 'open letter' from Charlie Sheen on his diagnosis. An open letter from Charlie Sheen: Roughly four years ago, I suddenly found myself in the throws of a seismic and debilitating three-day cluster-migraine-like headache. I was emergently hospitalized with what I believed to be a brain tumor or perhaps some unknown pathology. I was partially correct. Following a battery of endless tests, that included a hideous spinal tap, it was sadly and shockingly revealed to me that I was, in fact, positive for HIV. The news was a \"mule kick\" to my soul. Those impossible words I absorbed and then tried to convince myself, that I was stuck, suspended, or even stranded inside some kind of alternate reality or nightmare, were to the absolute contrary. I was awake. It was true\u2026 reality. Under the brilliant and perfect care of Dr. Robert Huizenga as well as \"the\" leading infectious disease expert in the known universe, I began a rigorous and intensive treatment program. Not missing a beat, a med dose, or one shred of guidance, quickly my viral loads became undetectable. Like every other challenge in my life, again, I was victorious and kicking this disease's ass. I wish my story had ended there. Unfortunately, for my family and myself, it had only just begun. (As quoted by today.com) The personal disbelief, karmic confusion, shame and anger lead to a temporary yet abysmal descent into profound substance abuse and fathomless drinking. It was a suicide run. Problem was, I'd forgotten that I'm too tough for such a cowardly departure. Yet, despite this loathsome and horrific odyssey, I was vigilant with my anti-viral program. READ: Charlie Sheen says he is HIV positive My medical team could only shake their heads as each and every blood test returned levels revealing a state of remission. Even though I might have been trying to kill myself, one thing was radically evident; the disease was not. In and around this perplexing and difficult time, I dazedly chose (or hired) the companionship of unsavory and insipid types. Regardless of their salt-less reputations, I always lead with condoms and honesty when it came to my condition. Sadly, my truth soon became their treason, as a deluge of blackmail and extortion took center stage in this circus of deceit. To date, I have paid out countless millions to these desperate charlatans. Locked in a vacuum of fear, I chose to allow their threats and skulduggery to vastly deplete future assets from my children, while my \"secret\" sat entombed in their hives of folly (or so I thought). News Flash: This ends today. I'm claiming back my freedom. The scales of justice will swiftly and righteously re-balance themselves. In conclusion, I accept this condition not as a curse or scourge, but rather as an opportunity and a challenge. An opportunity to help others. A challenge to better myself. Every day, of every month, of every year, countless individuals go to work, man their stations, fulfill their professional obligations with a host of disabilities. Diseases, imperfections, hurdles, detours. These maladies range from lupus to cancer, from paralysis to blindness, from diabetes to obesity. \"Treated,\" HIV is no different. My partying days are behind me. My philanthropic days are ahead of me. Ernest Hemingway once wrote, \"Courage is grace under pressure.\" I've served my time under pressure; I now embrace the courage, and the grace.

The student\u2014Shaan\u2014has been studying in the Bengali-medium Deepsikha Nursery School that has students up to class III. The child's mother, ironically an NGO worker engaged in HIV awareness, has resolved that if her son does continue studies, it will be at Deepsikha or not at all. The grandmother, who is a Bengali teacher in the very school, had to undergo HIV test to prove she was not a carrier before being allowed to continue. Shaan's mother Sujata learned about his condition mid-January when he was tested after she herself had tested positive the previous month. Her husband Sanjit had earlier been detected HIV+ in May 2014. Though devastated by the test result, Sujata who is engaged in awareness on HIV and AIDS for an NGO decided to immediately inform the school headmaster on ethical grounds. \u201cSince my son studies with others, it is important that the teachers know about it so that if he is hurt and suffers a cut leading to blood loss, he is handled carefully and does not infect others. Sanjib Naskar, the headmaster, was extremely nice and assured me that he would personally ensure that Shaan did not face any trouble,\u201d she recounted. Life carried on as usual till June when Sujata received a bolt from the blue. Naskar called her one day and told her that her son could not study in the school any longer as other guardians were opposed to it. \u201cI didn't even know that word had got around and everyone knew Shaan's condition. When I reminded the headmaster about the assurance, he pleaded helplessness as he was under pressure. No amount of reasoning helped,\u201d she said. Though Sujata did send him to school the following day, he was not allowed entry. Shaan has stayed home since. Sujata alleged that a school teacher even telephoned her and rebuked her for trying to questioning the headmaster's decision. \u201cNo one has any idea about HIV. When I tried to explain that other kids were not at threat, they refused to listen and remained adamant,\u201d she said. The ingorance is such that Shaan's grandmother, a Bengali teacher in the school, was forced to undergo blood tests and allowed to continue only after the results were negative. When TOI asked the headmaster why he had reneged on his assurance, Naskar did a U-turn and said that he hadn't shut the door on Shaan but had only informed his mother about the objections from other guardians. \u201cI want him to attend school but the parents are not sending him. But it is true that over 100 guardians signed a petition and submitted to me for Shaan's removal from the school,\u201d he said. On an after-thought, Naskar added that the child's fees were also due for several months. Sujata acknowledged that fees had not been paid for several months but claimed it was because the headmaster had waived the fees. District magistrate PB Saleem said he was aware of the mother's complaint and had asked the block development officer to conduct a thorough enquiry into it to ascertain the facts. \u201cWhatever be the case, the child's education must not be affected. I will do whatever it takes to get him back to school,\u201d he said."}

Talking to TOI, President of CNP+, Rinki Arora said the orphan child, who was living with his relatives in Durg, was on first line treatment but due to failure of medicines, he was referred to Raipur ART centre one year back. Rinki said since Raipur ART has the facility of providing second line drugs in the state, they had been pursuing the matter with them for the child\u2019s treatment but the same was being delayed on one pretext or the other. She said due to lack of treatment, the child\u2019s condition had started worsening and they contacted State AIDS Control Society (SACS), Additional Project director, Dr SK Binjhwar, who in turn directed the Raipur ART centre on Wednesday to start the treatment the very next day. Rinki said when they contacted the ART on Thursday morning, they were asked to get the child on Nov 24, despite being told about his critical condition. She said the child succumbed to his infection on Thursday afternoon. Blaming the ART for the child\u2019s death, Rinki said for the past one year the child was denied treatment despite follow ups with the authorities. She said this is not the first such case and claimed that seven other HIV patients have died due to the same reasons. When TOI contacted Dr Binjhwar, he denied the allegations and said, \u201cApparently there was some communication gap\u201d, Insisting that the child was not denied medication or treatment, Binjhwar said the child\u2019s relatives were asked to bring him to the ART on Thursday but they never came. When asked why the child was denied treatment for this long despite being referred to the ART for second line treatment over a year back, Binjhwar said the patient\u2019s report of viral load test, which was sent to Kolkata, had not been received so far. He said this report, which measures the number of HIV virus particles in a milliliter of blood, is essential for deciding the correct dosage for the patient. However, Binjhwar admitted that medicines could have been provided to the child, under expert guidance, since he was in a critical condition."}

However, confirmatory tests are yet to be done. All those tested HIV positive during screening were advised to undergo second and third round of confirmatory tests,\u201c a Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) official said. The HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) 2010-11, released recently, showed that the prevalence of HIV AIDS has increased from 0.19% (in 2008-09) to 0.32% in 2010-11. Now, the health authorities have expressed concern over the high percentage of HIV cases among migratory population. According to the official, they screened 20,037 persons for HIV during the 10day camps organised in 100 different villages of 11 districts. The villages were identified on the basis of large number of people migrating to other states for work and returning during festive season. In terms of numbers, the official said that they found 119 persons who tested positive for HIV during the screening. He said that these 119 persons were not even aware that they were infected with HIV . He said that migratory population is always at risk of having HIV . It is a high risk group as they have to stay outside their homes for a long period without their spouses to earn livelihood. Accredited social health activist (ASHA) workers helped RSACS in identifying 100 villages with high migratory population. Apart from HIV screening, the camps were organised for health check-up.There were doctors in the camps who provided consultation to the persons who visited the camps.

However, in June Naskar informed the child\u2019s mother that several guardians have submitted a petition, demanding expulsion of her son.

The first 29 years were marked with victory as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) metamorphosed from being the deadliest word in public health to just another chronic disease such as diabetes or hypertension. that can be managed well with medicines. But experts warn that complacency, accompanied by a sharp drop in funding, could prove to be costly for India. Consider Mumbai for instance. HIV among the city's general population fell from 3.6% in 2013-14 to 3% in 2014-15.But the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) that manages health programmes for HIV+ AIDS people has been managing with a third of its annual budget of Rs 25 crore. \"Medicines have had a marvellous effect on the HIVAIDS epidemic so far. Every patient who has managed to get these medicines has not done poorly But we could head for big trouble if patients don't adhere to drugs or fail to get it in time,\" said infectious diseases specialist Dr George Oomen. The country has faced a stockout of HIV drugs in the past few years. Indeed, while year-on-year, incidence of new infection among the general population and pregnant women has shown a significant decline, that among risk groups continues to be a cause for concern. As per the HIV sentinel surveillance data of 2010-11, HIV among female sex workers in the city was around 6%, way higher than the national prevalence of 2.7%. However, the main sentiment on the eve of World AIDS Day is of positivity. \"What is the difference between HIV in 1985 and 2015? HIV+ people don't really frighten others anymore,\" said Ashok Row Kavi of Humsafar Trust, one of the first organisations started in the country to advocate for rights of men who have sex with men (MSM). \"People are living a prolonged life with antiretroviral therapy (ART),\" he said. Our biggest achievement is that we have killed the fear.\" Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, MDACS, said, \"We have come from a stage when HIV prevalence in Kamathipura was 54.3% in 2003. Today, the awareness is massive and everyone knows about ways of prevention.\" Mumbai currently has over 30,000 people living with the disease. A senior NGO member , who worked with FSWs in Kamathipura, said the disease is no longer a death sentence. \"We probably don't even know how many women must have died of AIDS. It is a rare thing today.\" But a doctor said the Indian program faces problems that government officials aren't ready to accept. so far. \"Less than a tenth of those who need second -line HIV drugs access them under the government programme. These patients will not only develop further resistance but even spread the disease in the community,\" hes aid. He added the happy picture could crumble in a few years at the rate it's progressing. \"The Centre has washed it hands of funding HIV AIDS programmes and states haven't realised their importance.\""}

This is the centre she has been visiting for tests for three years; she also received her medicines from the hospital here. Now, her future hangs in balance. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I will manage my treatment now. I had a proper place to stay at and healthy food to eat whenever I went to Dehradun. We want the chief minister to come forward and support the only community centre that was supportive of HIV/AIDS patients,\u201d Antaral told TOI. Many other children with little support from society or families found help at this centre. The cash-starved centre has now received no help from the state government either, despite the very commendable service it has rendered. The community centre was established in 2009 under the aegis of National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), to provide free residential facilities and nutritional food to people living with HIV/AIDS, including women and children. About 2000 patients avail the facility annually. The centre was run by the Agnes Kunj Society (AKS). In just this financial year, over 370 people have visited the centre; half of these were children. The state government holds the Centre responsible for the shutting down of this facility, as it drew funds from NACO. Officials at AKS, who manage the facility, said the expenses incurred at the centre are just about Rs18 lakh per year \u2013 a sum the state government should not find so hard to shell out. Neera Kumari (27), an HIV-positive woman, has been travelling for the past five years from Chamoli (275 km from Dehradun) with her husband, who is also HIV-positive. The couple would get their medicines from here before returning home. \u201cThis was one place where we did not feel discriminated against. We were not alone here \u2013 there were about 15 couples we would meet once in a while who availed the services. The health department needs to think about getting another facility opened, if this must shut. Either open up AIDS medicine or test centres in each block or get us a proper community centre like AKS,\u201d Kumari said. Kailash Joshi, who works as head of administration at the health directorate, told TOI, \u201cThere is nothing to be done. We are trying to get things working. I cannot say much, I joined this post only recently.\u201d Officials had met the chief minister in this matter on November 23, but no resolution was found. Meanwhile, patients complain that although the chief minister and the health officials talk of providing free transport and social security numbers, there is little help forthcoming when they actually need help. Lawrence Singh, project coordinator at Agnes Kunj Society, said, \u201cWe tried to offer the best services possible. Now, even our resources have run out. Our centre was used not only by local people but also residents of neighbouring states like UP and Himachal. It would be nice if the health department understood the condition of patients not accepted in their own families and society. We had so many patients come here for a place to stay and get good food. They came for treatment and counselling, and some were really small children.\u201d"}

Agricultural labourers and housewives were among the majority to be infected, highlighting the need for strengthening the HIV programme, which is going through a severe fund crunch. An analysis by the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) found that young people contributed to 42% fresh infections, while 6% were adolescents. It showed that 28,925 people tested positive for HIV out of the 21.37 lakh tested. Despite a constant decline in new infections across the state, young adults and adolescents, particularly in rural pockets, continue to be the most vulnerable due to lack of adequate knowledge or access to it. Women accounted for 56% new infections, while it was 43% among men and 1% in the transgender community. But the trend in Mumbai is the opposite, where most infections are still seen in men, and only 36% are detected in women. The study showed how education played a pivotal role in an individual getting the infection. About 29% who contracted the virus were illiterate and 35% had primary education. The graph dropped to 28% among those who completed secondary education and to 8% for those with college degrees and above. Infectious disease consultant Dr Om Srivastava said people in their early teens and pre-20s are the most vulnerable due to limited access to information or resources. \u201cThere is an element of irresponsibility for those beyond 20-22 as they have access to funds, resources and information,\u201d he said. Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) president Dr Sagar Mundada said pre-marital testing should be promoted on a larger scale. The highest infection (42%) was detected in the 36-50 age group. Incidentally, a year-on-year increase in this age group has been noted in Kolhapur. HIV in the 51-60 age group stood at 8% and among senior citizens 3%. Dr Shobhna Tehra of MSACS said, \u201cThe disease is well under control. Our testing has doubled and infections have halved.\u201d Fresh infections have declined by 45% over the last five years in the city. Among the newly-infected, 78% are aged 15-49, said Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS). Around 93% of the infections were due to unsafe sex. But an expert said, \u201cThe cloud of uncertainty has to be cleared from the programme that is struggling with demotivated workers and high attrition.\u201d The MSACS has received only Rs 11.89 crore for the year despite having an approved budget of Rs 104.73 crore from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO)."}

Facts related to the disease such as prime causes and how it decreased a person\u2019s immunity leading to his death were discussed. Addressing the gathering, Dr TVS Arya, nodal officer, ART Centre, said, \u201cStudents should know that immunity of a person suffering from AIDS is quite low and hence he cannot fight infections such as common cold and cough. Even cold can aggravate matters and lead to pneumonia.\u201d Dr Arya further said ignoring symptoms such as consistent loose motions, weight loss, cough, common cold, etc. could further deteriorate a person\u2019s health. \u201cIf AIDS symptoms are detected, one should go for tests immediately. If the results are found to be HIV+, the patient should start treatment immediately. The prime reason for the spread of the disease is being in sexual contact with more than one partner. Other reasons include sharing of needles between drug users and infected blood transfusion,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, sessions will also be organized for doctors on Tuesday wherein they will be sensitized on how to treat AIDS patients and not discriminate against them. An awareness seminar is scheduled to be held at Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial (LLRM) Medical College. \u201cWe\u2019ve come across several cases wherein doctors don\u2019t know how to treat AIDS patients. They require utmost care and love. AIDS patients should not be discriminated against because the disease cannot be spread by touch,\u201d said Dr Arya. Discussing the issue, Dr Ramesh Chandra, chief medical officer, Meerut, said, \u201cWorld AIDS Day is a day to remind doctors how to treat AIDS patients and educate people on how to prevent the disease from spreading. I\u2019m glad all these points will be covered in Tuesday\u2019s programme.\u201d Earlier this year, a doctor at LLRM Hospital had pasted a board on the bed of a patient that screamed HIV+ and the patient was also made to clean her own medical waste."}

When her husband \u2013 who works in Mumbai to provide for his family \u2013 came back home this Diwali, she insisted on an HIV test before he entered home. But, her husband wouldn\u2019t agree. So, Anita decided he would not let him share her bed till he was in Udaisarai. Vidya, another resident of this village and a mother of two, too would not allow her husband Ram Kishore enter home till a blood test showed he was HIV negative. Not that Anita and Vidya were not happy that their husbands were home for Diwali. But, they were scared that they could get with them more them the money and Diwali gifts for all. They were afraid the men may get them disease and death \u2013 carrying back home with them the deadly HIV. The women in this village, where most make members work in Mumbai for a living, have united and are fighting this virus in a unique way: They are making the menfolk \u2013 through persuasion and even force \u2013 under a test to check for HIV as soon as they reach the village from Mumbai. Their fears aren\u2019t misplaced. For, Udaisarai was like any other village in Uttar Pradesh \u2013 surviving on income from agriculture and money orders from men working in Mumbai and other cities in western India \u2013 till a screening camp 10 years ago made their world turn topsy turvy. Results of blood tests in the camp revealed most of the males were carrying the deadly virus. The village, with a population \u2026 and with members from about 200 homes working in other states, has lost as many as 44 people in the past decade. With death staring them in the face, women have taken strong steps. And, if the wives are ensuring HIV tests for husbands and safe sex, they are being supported by their mothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. \u201cWe are helping them save themselves from the scourge of infection and stigma. This Diwali, the women told the men to get themselves tested for HIV when the returned home,\u201d said Gyan Swaroopa, an anganwadi worker who has played a key role in spreading awareness in the village. It was Vidya who took the lead and made her husband undergo a blood test at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre at the Fatehpur district hospital. \u201cI have seen members of families which got infected die one by one. Even medicines do not work. The trauma is unbearable. So, I asked my husband to get himself checked,\u201d said Vidya. But not all spouses are cooperative. Anita had to struggle to make her husband take the test. \u201cI did not let him into my room for two days as he refused to take the test. I even did not let him share my bed for the rest of the days,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was my mother-in-law who made him agree, reminding him of the deaths village have died. Village elders too convinced him and he donated his sample before leaving for Mumbai. The report is awaited,\u201d she added. When Sangeeta\u2019s husband came home for Diwali, it was her sister-in-law, who herself had lost her husband, who convinced him for the test. Sangeeta\u2019s family heaved a sigh of relief when he turned out to be HIV negative. Sangeeta had stopped communicating with her husband till he agreed. But, when Rekha, who was married just about six months ago, could not convince her husband for the test, she ensured that he used condoms. But not all had it easy. When another resident Rani Devi insisted that her husband underwent a test, he retorted: \u201cTum humko bataogi ki kya karna hai (Will you tell me what I should do?).\u201d ASHA worker Karuna Devi said threat of importing HIV infection from Mumbai still looms over the hamlet. Village head Dharam Raj revealed that at least 250 residents from 200 families worked in Mumbai and came back home only on festivals. \u201cNo one knows what these men do when they are far away, living alone. We counsel youth and men when they leave Fatehpur for work. The stand taken by the women of the village is laudable,\u201d said village pradhan Dharam Raj. Elders who work in Mumbai also keep an eye on the younger men. \u201cInstead of staying on the streets, we get together and pool in money to rent common rooms. This has minimized men visiting commercial sex workers,\u201d said Ramesh Kumar, who has been working in Mumbai since 1999. Social organisations working in HIV prevention in the village are also helping empower women. President of Nehru Yuva Sangathan, Rajendra Sahu said: \u201cWomen are better change-makers than anyone else. An aware woman force in the village has checked the rate of new cases in the past few years.\u201d STATS 357 cases of HIV reported in Fatehpur in 2005-15. Of these 48 cases were reported last year In Udaisarai village, 52 HIV reactive cases came to fore in a health camp held in 2005 As many as 44 persons, including five families, have died in this period As on date, 12 patients of HIV are undergoing treatment Risk of TB looms large over most patients here Read this story in Hindi: \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u0905\u0921\u093c\u0940\u0902, HIV \u0930\u093f\u092a\u094b\u0930\u094d\u091f \u0915\u0947 \u092c\u093f\u0928\u093e \u092a\u0924\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u0928\u094b \u090f\u0902\u091f\u094d\u0930\u0940"}

In the last 10 months (till October 31, 2015), the district officially recorded 160 positive cases of AIDS, including 100 men and 60 women. In 2014, 99 men and 45 women were found infected with the virus. A slight decline had been seen in the number of cases over the past three years. The district had recorded 198 positive cases in 2012. In 2013, that number had gone down to 145, with a further decline recorded in 2014, when 144 people were found positive. However, the number of cases has gone up this year, crossing the 160 mark in October. \"We get people from all backgrounds. There are labourers as well as college and school students.

Despite awareness about the virus, most of them don't go for safe sex, constantly indulging in unsafe sex instead,\" said a counsellor at one of the centres on condition of anonymity. Dr Vijay Kumar, nodal officer for AIDS and TB in the district, though, felt the centre has been successful in bringing down AIDS cases, keeping in mind the city's rapidly increasing population. \"We've been regularly conducting awareness programmes in school, colleges and public places via street plays and discussions. There has been a marginal increase, reflected in the number of people, especially women, coming for counselling sessions. It's also compulsory to conduct HIV test of all pregnant women approaching government hospitals nowadays. This could be a reason for the spike in the number of infected women,\" he told TOI.

Started in February 2014, the initiative is being taken very seriously by the two medical colleges in the city. Both the medical colleges in city have an ART centre. A new ART centre has also come up recently at Kamptee which has given an added option to patients. Yet, most continue to flock the two medical colleges only. Earlier, under the National AIDS Control Organisation\u2019s HIV positive pregnant women as well as the new born child were given a single dose of Nevirapine medicine under the PACT (Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission) programme. But this could only bring down the percentage of the HIV positive children to half (from 10 to 5%). But, since 2014, a new drug called Tenofovir Lamividine (TLE) is being given to HIV positive pregnant women all over India. They have to take a single pill everyday lifelong to ensure that both the mothers and their children do not get AIDS. This is a very effective drug. But it has to be taken every day lifelong by a HIV positive women. It works very well if patients adhere to the drug and take it daily at bedtime. It can completely prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to child. GMCH acting dean Dr PG Dixit told TOI that this was a novel effort on the part of the NACO. Since the launch of the programme in GMCH, 69 women have been on the new drug. All of them are adhering well to the therapy. The biggest advantage of the programme is that the patient has to just take a single tablet or pill as compared to the earlier regime of ART which included 2-3 drugs. It has also improved the compliance by patient. And since all women coming to government set up requiring anti natal care (ANC) are being screened 100% the chances of missing a positive case is very little. Earlier, HIV positive pregnant women were being screened for their CD4 count and only those with low count were given the ART treatment. But now every positive women is being given the therapy. Children earlier were followed for six weeks. But now children are also being followed till the age of five years. The only apparent problem that can create problem in functioning of the system is that the as per the central government plan the NACO is going to end the National AIDS Control Programme in phases by 2017 and hence has already started withdrawing from funding the projects. The programme has already been merged with National Rural health Mission. State governments are expected to take over the responsibility gradually. But since state government is not doing so problems of staff not getting salaries under the programme have already begun.

However, the lax attitude of state government towards a disease that does not even have a cure, has scared activists that the infection may rise with a vengeance in the coming years. Between January and September this year, NGOs working towards AIDS prevention among the various vulnerable groups didn\u2019t get any funds from the state government. They also faced a huge scarcity of basic supplies like medicines, STI testing kits and condoms that they distribute free to the group they work among. This had forced several organizations to shut down the projects they were working on. The funds needed for continuing their projects had been released from NACO, but not released to the organizations by the state government. \u201cThe work of several years would be undone by inactivity of a couple of months. People we cater to are often the kind who would use a service like STI testing only when they are provided free of cost. They would not go out buying condoms despite knowing the obvious dangers,\u201d said Anand Chandrani from Sarathi Trust that works among the LGBT population. He said that the populations that were being served by the NGOs who have shut down their projects may take up the HIV prevalence rate. The District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) programme officer Tanuja Fale acknowledges the role of the NGOs in reducing the infection rate spreading awareness. \u201cWe are aware of the temporary shortages of medicines and testing kits of the NGOs. There are extra provisions in the ART centres at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGMCH) that they can make use of. If they take the patients there, they can also get additional facilities like check-ups and counselling,\u201d she said. It is difficult to keep up the morale of the on-ground staff since they are not getting salaries for some months now, said Varsha Pagale of Indian Institute of Youth Welfare (IIYW) who works with female sex workers. \u201cTI population often doesn\u2019t want to reveal their identities so they don\u2019t prefer to take any treatment in public hospitals. ART centres are open only between 9am and noon which is not a very convenient window for most of them,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo months worth of expenses were given to the NGOs in September and the next instalment that has also been released to the state government will be given to them by February. State officials told us that due procedures need to be followed like verification of the statement of expenses before releasing the money,\u201d said an official from Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS). He added that they were told that they have to deal with several departments and files.

The report 'Adolescents: Under the Radar in the Asia-Pacific AIDS Response', published by the Asia-Pacific Inter-Agency Task Team on Young Key Populations, which includes UNICEF and the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS warned that the AIDS epidemic cannot be ended as a public health threat by 2030 without tackling the issue of adolescents. In 2014, 220,000 adolescents aged 10-19 were estimated to be living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific. India is among the 10 countries in the region accounting for 98 per cent of those aged 10 to 19 living with HIV. The other countries are Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Prevalence is particularly high in large cities like Mumbai, Hanoi, Jakarta, Bangkok, Chiang Mai and other urban areas. The 2014 figure accounts for almost 15 per cent of all new cases in the region. Although new infections are falling overall, they are rising among adolescents, coinciding with an increase in risky behaviour, such as multiple sexual partners and inconsistent condom use. The report, released ahead of World AIDS Day on Tuesday, added that in hotspot urban areas, HIV prevalence can be many times the national prevalence. In general, female sex workers in Asia and the Pacific are 29 times more likely to be living with HIV compared with all women of reproductive age, according to a global systematic review in low and middle-income countries. \"The Asia-Pacific region is facing a hidden epidemic of HIV among adolescents, with an estimated 50,000 new infections in 2014 among those aged 15 to 19,\" the report said calling on governments to develop specifically targeted prevention strategies. Those at highest risk include gay men and other men who have sex with men, transgender people, injecting drug users, and people who buy and sell sex. In India, HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men is 3.5 per cent for those younger than 25 years while it is 4.9 per cent for men older than 25. HIV prevalence among sex workers under 25 years of age in India was 1.7 per cent for the 2007-2014 period."}

This was revealed in the new data divulged by Assam State Aids Control Society (ASACS) on Monday. As on September 30, 11,122 people were identified as HIV- positive. Despite the fact that Assam is categorized as a low HIV-prevalence state with 0.07% of an estimated adult HIV prevalence as compared to the national prevalence of 0.27%, there is still a lot to worry about. As on September 30, 4,268 HIV-positive cases were detected in Kamrup (Metro) districts, 2413 in Cachar, 734 in Dibrugarh and 513 in Nagaon. As per data collected from recent HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) among ante-natal clinic attendees or pregnant women, Karimganj, Tinsukia and Karbi Anglong districts have shown a consistent high HIV prevalence. Cachar and Sonitpur districts have both recorded more than 1% HIV prevalence among pregnant women as per HSS, 2015. Based on the analysis of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) data, it showed a rising trend of HIV positivity among pregnant women. The analysis of the data also revealed a stable trend of HIV positivity among general clients, said Chiranjeev Bhattacharjya, state epidemiologist, ASACS. Adult HIV prevalence in the state has shot up from 0.04% in 2007 to 0.07% in 2011. As annual new HIV infections have shown a downward trend in high prevalence states of Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland, annual new HIV infections in Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh have increased. Both in Assam and Tripura, the rate of increase in annual new HIV infections is highest. The rate of positivity per thousand in Assam is 4.93. \"This is something we have to work on. Evidence suggests that both in Assam and Tripura there are some emerging pockets of HIV infections. The same evidence suggests that HIV infections are mostly concentrated among female sex workers, injecting drug users and among men having sex with men, added Bhattacharya. The HSS data revealed that HIV epidemic in the state is mostly focussed on high- risk groups like injected drug users comprising a 1.46%, men having sex with men (1.4%) and female sex workers (0.46%). But challenges remain in collecting accurate data from the bridge population (migrant and truck drivers) due to the absence of HIV Sentinel Site in Assam. Sentinel sites can be defined as special study fields to focus on groups at risk of contracting HIV infection risk. The government of India still hasn't allocated such sites in Assam for which it is impossible to study the role of such population in spreading HIV infection. Similarly, a trend analysis couldn't be performed in MSM as there are no consistent sites for this high-risk group."}

On the one hand, the prevalence of HIV among various vulnerable groups has been coming down in the state. On the other, there seems to be a reduction in the central government funds to NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation) for AIDS control programmes and IEC activities (information, education and communication) undertaken through the various SACS (State AIDS Control Society). According to officials of the AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS), in 2014-15, 32,190 new HIV cases were identified in the state with Guntur, East Godavari and Krishna being the most vulnerable districts mainly due to presence of high number of migrants and truckers. Between April to September 2015, 4,00,090 got tested, out of which 12,742 were confirmed as HIV positive in AP. Currently, 1,28,760 people are living with HIV and are under medication in AP, among which 11,566 are from Vizag district. \"In accordance with the theme of 'Getting to Zero- Zero New HIV Infections, Zero Stigma and Discrimination, Zero AIDS Related Deaths', the overall incidence of HIV/AIDS is coming down in the state but we still don't have a comparative statistics yet as the entire data of the combined state is with Telangana and we are trying to get the AP data post bifurcation. Even then, if we compare the overall prevalence among the high risk groups at present with those three-four years ago, we find that in almost all cases, the prevalence rate has come down,\" stated additional project director (APD) of APSACS Rajendra Prasad. \"In ante-natal women, the prevalence rate is 0.1% now as compared to more than 1.5% three-four years earlier. Similarly, in female sex workers, it has come down from 8% to 4% and in MSMs (men who have sex with men) it's 8% as compared to 10% three years ago. Only in case of Injectable Drug Users (IDUs), the cases have gone up from 8% to 10%. We are trying to implement employer-need models in industries to generate awareness among workers too. We also feel the need for generation of continuous awareness and more IEC activities, which has slowed down,\" Prasad said. Speaking on IEC and other issues, an official from Naco working with State Aids Control Society, requesting anonymity, said, \"There's some problem regarding availability of funds to fight AIDS. The combined state of AP-Telangana got Rs 115 crore in 2014. But this year, only Rs 94 crore has been given by the Centre. In fact, the central government has asked the respective state governments to contribute 20 per cent of the funds. Given the fund crunch in the two states, such a move may hamper AIDS control programmes. Even IEC activities need to be continued without gaps because today's children would be tomorrow's youth and therefore a sustainable approach is needed to curtail incidence of HIV. Any neglect at this juncture would escalate the incidences. Since the last one year, the supply of condoms and drugs are also erratic.\" Additional district medical and health officer of Vizag (ADMHO - AIDS and Leprosy) Dr Ronanki Ramesh said that there had been some fund issues after bifurcation and the budget has not been finalised yet. Meanwhile, on the occasion of World AIDS Day, a rally has been organised by the district administration and medical and health department from GVMC Gandhi Statue to AU Assembly Hall. HIV expert Padmashree Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao will also release a unique calendar on POSITIVE SIGN In 2014-15, 32,190 new HIV cases were identified with Guntur, East Godavari and Krishna being the most vulnerable districts Between April to September 2015, 4,00,090 got tested out of which 12,742 confirmed as HIV positive in AP Currently, 1,28,760 people are living with HIV and on ART drugs in AP among which 11,566 are from Vizag district *Data from APSACS"}

As a part of the campaign, the resident doctors throughout the state would also give sex-cum-reproductive education for youths in the age group of 15 and 25 and clear myths about HIV. MARD president Sagar Mundada said, \"Among the plans chalked out during the awareness campaign, we will be clearing myths about spread of HIV and clearing the facts that HIV can be contacted through only three ways - sexual intercourse, mother to child transmission and incorrect blood transfusions.\" Doctors will also click selfies with patients of HIV to communicate the message that the disease does not spread by touching or hugging. Medicos, too, will be educated regarding recent changes in HIV treatment protocols by WHO as many still are not aware about it, he added. \"The programme also includes creating awareness throughout this week that it is not HIV per se but secondary infections which causes death. So if patients take medication regularly, their immunity will be good and infections can be delayed. We will also sensitize people that those who claim to have the cure for AIDS are just quacks and that they should not fall prey to such false promises,\" said MARD secretary Ayudh Magdum. The campaign would encourage youth to go for HIV test before marriage with slogan 'Test karo, kundali bhul jao'. \"We will encourage young couples to test for HIV rather than matching kundalis and resident doctors and MARD members will take pledge that they will lead the way by testing themselves before marriage,\" said Mundada. Meanwhile, all resident doctors will sport the AIDs red ribbon for 7 days throughout the state. \"Display boards with messages - Testing first, Kundali comes secondary, this small step can help avoid disastrous consequences and it should be a thing everybody feels comfortable with rather than feeling embarrassed. Around 100 boards will be displayed in each medical college throughout this week encouraging people to take a pledge that they will get themselves tested for HIV before marriage. Also, all those who decide to do the same will be given a certificate of appreciation from MARD and also will be given medical help by the MARD member who will supervise his treatment,\" he said."}

The present method to screen HIV has a four-week window period (the time between a person is infected and the virus infection starts showing up in the tests). The decision to introduce NAT came about when health minister Deepak Sawant was reviewing HIV AIDS cases in the state in a meeting with Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS). The minister was informed that of the 11 lakh donor blood samples tested across the state, more than 2,500 were found to be HIV+. This means that these HIV+ had donated blood during the window period (and probably did not know that they were infected). The minister was also told that NAT test ing is very important to reduce the risk of HIV infection though blood transfusion. To put things in perspective, at least 1,000 people in Maharashtra contracted HIV in the past five years due to blood transfusions. \"It was in January this year that the NAT proposal was discussed with the health minister and he finally pushed the proposal to the Centre,\" said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, Project Director, MSCAS. Presently all blood banks follow the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) guidelines and use fourth generation HIV Elisa testing kits to screen blood for HIV. According to Pardesi, NACO has sanctioned Rs 18 crore for the NAT test. Six districts -Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Nashik, Nagpur and Ahmedanagar -will have NAT centers and around 300 blood banks will be attached to the centers. Blood samples from all over the state will be sent to one of these centers for testing. Currently, only two private hospitals in the city - Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital (Andheri) and PD Hinduja hospital (Mahim) have NAT equipment. While a single ELISA test cost Rs 200, NAT costs Rs 1,000 per test. \"The cost of installing NAT equipment is high. Therefore, it took time to install the facility in state. We will also provide training to the lab technician for the NAT testing,\" said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, Project Director, MSCAS. Karnataka was the first state in the country to implement the NAT system in all government blood banks. For more stories, follow us on Twitter and Facebook"}

Without a solid safe framework, the body experiences difficulty fending off malady. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It is the virus that can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. HIV is a virus spread through certain body fluids that attacks the body\u2019s natural immune system. The damage to the immune system makes it harder and harder for the body to fight off infections and some other diseases. Here are a few signs and symptoms of HIV which you should look out for. HIV Sign and Symptom 1 : Fever One symptom that comes in the very beginning is fever known as Acute Retroviral Syndrome (ARS). Fever is ordinarily accompanied with symptoms like tiredness and body torment. HIV Sign and Symptom 2 : Fatigue At the point when the infection enters the blood, the vulnerable immune system is hit. Likewise, aggravation because of poor immunity causes exhaustion and fatigue. HIV Sign and Symptom 3 : Skin rash Rash is the most common symptom of HIV. For a person with HIV, the skin can become extremely sensitive to irritants and sunlight. This effect can show up at the beginning or at a later stage. On the off chance that the skin rash isn't effortlessly treated then it could be because of the HIV infection. HIV Sign and Symptom 4 : Weight loss The people suffering from HIV or those who have just fallen sick with HIV generally lose weight rapidly due to the above symptoms. HIV Sign and Symptom 5 : Dry cough and pneumonia Dry cough should be immediately treated with common treatments. If it is done so, this persistent coughing can lead to pneumonia, which is a sign of the HIV virus. HIV Sign and Symptom 6 : Nausea and vomiting These squeamish inclinations which are not effectively treated could suggest HIV contamination. HIV Sign and Symptom 7 : Joint and muscle pain Lymph nodes shape some portion of the resistant framework which is our immune system. When the immune system is tainted by HIV virus, the lymph nodes get inflamed giving a sign of HIV disease. HIV Sign and Symptom 8 : Night Sweats HIV infected individuals also experience night sweats. This symptom is very similar to women entering menopause. There are a few ways which may help you beat the HIV virus. Here we have mentioned those natural ways that you can add into your daily life and habits to stay safe from the HIV virus. Tip # 1 \u2013 Fast for at least 1 day a week. Drink only the concoction made of distilled water, lemon juice and honey. Tip # 2 - Eat predigested proteins for maximum digestion. Products like soy milk contain soy protein and yogurt culture, and are great for health as well. Tip # 3 - Eat cultured proteins like yogurt made from soy milk, that is easily absorbed and digested, and contains acidophilus. This friendly flora produces lactic acid which destroys the bad bacteria. Tip # 4 - Take protein digestive enzymes if you eat hard to digest proteins like meat, eggs, fish or fowl. Tip # 5 - Eliminate those proteins from the diet that are hard to digest, like casein from dairy products and gluten\u2019s from wheat and, coagulated proteins from like in fried meats."}

The officials are also making efforts to contact neighbouring or other state ART centers if any LFU patient approached them. \u201cAs the DAPCU has complete details of patients undergoing ART at both block- and urban-pockets level, we have been making constant efforts to trace the LFU patients,\u201d claimed Dr Pandey, adding \u201cthere were cases when patients candidly refused to take up treatment and we had to work hard to convince and counsel them,\u201d he said. Officials claim counselling plays a vital role in convincing a patient for ART. Counselors and care support officials interact with them on frequent intervals to check the myths regarding the treatment. Secondly, awareness is the key to check the spread of the disease and both urban and rural populace are aware of the causes of aids\\hiv. Officials admit that street and folk plays have played a vital role in checking myths among rural belt of Allahabad. This fiscal year, a total of 4786 persons were registered for pre \u2013ART and 1,852 of them were enrolled for ART."}

We will also take guidance from the Centre about the measures that can be initiated in the coming months.\u201d As per MPSACS figures, out of total 1,39,106 patients screened for HIV, 2,361 were confirmed positive between January 2000 and October 2014. However, as per the screening survey till October 2015, out of 1,81,978 patients that underwent screening, 2,544 were confirmed positive. Ujjain replaced Gwalior in terms of number of HIV positive patients this year. Nodal officer for TB/HIV in Ujjain, Dr ML Malviya said, \u201cEvery year we are trying to screen more number of people for HIV. We are also carrying out awareness activities with the help of NGOs to sensitize people about the consequences of the deadly disease and precautions against it. As Simhastha is scheduled next year, MPSACS must be preparing its action plan.\u201d After Indore, Dhar and Ujjain are two districts along the NH3, which have a significant number of registered HIV positive cases. Being a pilgrim centre, Ujjain witnesses flow of visitors all the year round. Besides, there are truck drivers too. It results in a huge floating population. According to ART Centre incharge, MY Hospital, Dr VP Pandey, \u201cIf we look at the map of MP, we find prevalence more in developed and industrial areas. High-risk activity is more because of migrant workforce.\u201d"}

Sanjay (name changed), a 35-year-old resident of Bahanaga area in the coastal Balasore district, has been on a mission for the last couple of years to spread awareness about various aspects of AIDS and the HIV virus. He has, in fact, become an icon for hundreds of AIDS affected people in the region. Apart from looking out for HIV positive people and helping them as and when required, he has been attending awareness workshops and campaigns in the districts of Balasore, Bhadrak, Mayurbhanj, Jajpur, Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapara. While on the occasion of World AIDS Day on December 1, government and private organizations were busy holding closed door meetings and seminars at upmarket hotels in the cities, Sanjay, who is attached to a non-government organization, was spreading awareness in remote villages. \"I have met more than 500 HIV patients during such programmes and interacted with them. I feel it is an opportunity for me to make people aware about the dos and don'ts of the disease. Even though I am an HIV patient, I have never felt ashamed. My aim is to make our society HIV free,\" he said. As there is social stigma attached to the disease, HIV positive people face censure and humiliation from villagers and even family members in remote villages. Through his mission, Sanjay has been trying to make them familiar with the life and problems faced by an AIDS or HIV-affected person. He visits hospitals, collects data about HIV positive people and meets them personally to enquire whether they are facing any problems. Life was good for Sanjay till he completed Plus II and left for Mumbai in 1998 to work in a private company. He unknowingly came in contact with an HIV positive person from whom he is believed to have been affected with the disease. He had to return home in 2011 after he was diagnosed to be HIV positive. \"I felt like the sky broke down on me. However, I tried to get over the trauma and got myself treated. My family supported me a lot to overcome the stress and stigma attached to the disease. Later, I came in contact with volunteers who taught me how to have the patience to lead life,\" he said. In awareness meetings, he appeals to people not to worry or feel ashamed of being HIV positive or suffering from AIDS. \"Just lead a normal life and live happily till the end of your days,\" he advises them, besides letting them know about various social security schemes launched by the government for HIV patients."}

Mahua Choudhery and her team of researchers at Texas A&M University have come up with the hydrogel condom which could help in the global fight against HIV. The condom is made of an elastic polymer called hydrogel, and includes plant-based antioxidants that have anti-HIV properties. Choudhury, assistant professor at the Texas A&M Health Science Center's Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, is t. \"We are not only making a novel material for condoms to prevent the HIV infection, but we are also aiming to eradicate this infection if possible,\" Choudhury, assistant professor at the Texas A&M Health Science Center's Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, said . \"Supercondom could help fight against HIV infection and may as well prevent unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases and If we succeed, it will revolutionize the HIV prevention initiative,\" said Choudhury, the lead researcher. Choudhury, who studied Molecular Biology, Biophysics and Genetics in India before getting her PhD in the US, has been researching diabetes and the obesity epidemic. She was one of 54 people awarded the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's \"Grand Challenge in Global Health\" grant. This year's initiative asked winning recipients to create an affordable, latex-free condom to help battle the HIV epidemic, which is currently affecting 35 million people in the world. \"If you can make it really affordable, and really appealing, it could be a life-saving thing,\" Choudhury said. The condom material already exists as a water-based hydrogel for medical purposes such as contact lenses, researchers said. In addition to protecting against STDs and pregnancy, researchers enmeshed in the hydrogel design the antioxidant quercetin, which can prevent the replication of HIV and if the condom breaks, the quercetin would be released for additional protection. Researchers hope the condom will enjoy greater use and have a stronger effect at preventing the spread of HIV as the new design is more comfortable and also heightens sexual pleasure. The condom has already been created and now the only thing keeping it from going to market is an approval on its patent application. The researchers hope to test the condom within the next six months. Once released, the new condom will eventually be made available to everyone, including those in rural areas, where these types of resources are limited, Choudhury said. Since its outbreak in 1981, HIV virus has killed 39 million people."}

The method is less expensive owing to the easy availability of residue and offers double the yield compared to the use of straw for mushroom production. Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) Peruvannamoozhi, following the success of their first training in the use of banana crop residue, has started training more persons on the techniques. During the training programmes conducted the last two months the KVK stressed the use of banana crop residue along with the use of straw. \"Following the success of Satheesh Kumar, agri-entrepreneur from Kakkur panchayat we are stressing the use of banana crop residue for preparing mushroom beds,\" said Dr P Ratha Krishnan, programme coordinator of KVK. Mushroom cultivation assures household-level nutritional security and gives decent earnings with not much space and time. In order to boost this seasonal activity combined with the present banana harvesting season, KVK Peruvannamoozhi has trained over 500 people in the past couple of months, he added. Satheesh Kumar, who formerly was a photographer, is now a successful mushroom farmer as he ventured to depend on banana crop residue for preparing beds for mushroom cultivation. The man, who sells edible mushroom in the local market on a regular basis, prepares over 600 beds of mushroom simultaneously using pseudo stems and leaves of banana. The dried stems and leaves are collected from neighbouring localities for the purpose. \"Banana stems and leaves are easily available in rural areas and this makes the preparation of mushroom beds less expensive,\" said Satheesh Kumar. Moreover, the yield is almost double when we use banana crop residue for preparing mushroom beds compared to the yield when straw is used for preparing beds, he said. According to the farmer, who has been in mushroom production for one-and-a-half years, a bed prepared using 1 kilogram banana crop residue gives a yield of 1 to 1.5 kg or mushroom. The average yield when using straw, according to him, is 650 gram.

The Technical Research Group (TRG) has recently recommended community based screening using whole blood finger prick tests in population that has remained unaddressed. The TRG has also recommended testing in existing targeted intervention sites, community based screening through health camp approach for truckers and migrants, and provider initiated testing and counseling for pregnant women and TB patients. The NACO has also accepted the WHO's recommendation of using ancillary health care providers, including peer counsellors, for conducting HIV screening after adequate training. Other recommendations of TRG include acceptance of pre-test information instead of pre-test counseling and verbal consent in order to decrease the time and inconvenience for the testing and counseling procedure. The age of consent for HIV testing has also been recommended to be reduced to 16 instead of 18 to enhance early diagnosis. \"AIDS Healthcare Foundation has been a front-runner in the advocacy for community based testing globally for more than eight years and has conducted more than 7 million tests globally in the past two years. AHF, through its implementing partner in India, India Cares, has conducted more than 220000 tests and identified more than 1900 unreached people living with HIV/AIDS in India,\" said Dr Nochiketa Mohanty, country program manager, AHF India. \"HIV testing must be scaled up in a big way around the world. Governments need to embrace community-based streamlined testing models that use rapid testing technologies and make testing free, convenient, hassle-free and easily accessible, particularly for the most affected populations. Testing results should be available the same day and there needs to be strong linkage to care and services for those who test HIV-positive,\" said Terri Ford, AHF chief of global advocacy and policy."}

According to health experts, the girl probably was HIV+, which takes time to develop into AIDS. Police said Saira's pimp, Manohar Lal Gupta, a resident of Sector 56, Chandigarh, told them that she had AIDS. Saira worked in the city under the name of Poonam. Police said Gupta knew that Saira could spread infection and still sent her to his customers, which is also a crime.

Police caught Gupta when he, alongwith two of his friends, Payal and Rajan, were going to dump the girl's body. Saira was murdered at Rajan's place in Sector 10, Panchkula, when she had a heated argument with Gupta over a financial dispute. In the course of that argument, Gupta, Rajan and Payal smothered Saira to death, which was revealed in the postmortem examination conducted at the general hospital in Sector 6.Manohar Lal Gupta, Rajan and Payal were booked under the Section 302 (Punishment for murder), 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC.

The total number of people living with HIV is estimated at 21.17 lakh in 2015 compared with 22.26 lakh in 2007. While two-fifth of the total HIV infections are among women, children under 15 years of age accounted for 6.54% of the total cases. According to Nochiketa Mohanty, country programme manager, AIDS Healthcare Foundation, while there are programmes to prevent parent-to-child transmission of the virus, there is greater need to focus on women. \"There is huge need to ramp up education and awarnessness about HIV infection among women besides upgrading the social status of women in order to empower her to make choices related to her sexual partner,\" Mohanty said."}

The survey findings were released to the media on Friday.The state's mining and industrial pockets areas continue to record high prevalence of HIV cases despite numerous government intervention schemes.The findings, which are based on screening camps and integrated counseling and testing centres (ICTC) in 23 districts (excluding Garhwa), have recorded 1,496 positive cases in the past year. Of them, around 1,035 cases have been documented in the five districts. Ranchi has recorded 264 new cases, while Dhanbad has witnessed 114. East Singbhum district, including Jamshedpur, has recorded 188 new cases. Giridih has recorded 125 new HIV cases while Palamu has 132. However, Hazaribag has the most number of cases with 344 new infections in 2015. The survey is based on the screening of at least 1.07 lakh people, including priority groups such as sex workers, truck drivers and migrant workers, JSACS said. Dr Shami Akhtar, state programme officer for intervention in JSACS, said the number of new cases have recorded a marginal fall (0.02%) from 2014-15. During 2014-15, 1,645 new HIV infections were reported statewide. While Ranchi recorded 315 new infections during that period, Hazaribag remained the most affected with 463 positive cases out of 17,000 people screened. While the body attributed most of the new infections to migrant workers who were screened on their return home during festivals, JSACS suspects a larger number of unidentified HIV patients. \"The numbers can be anywhere between 30,000 to 36, 000 people,\" Akhtar said. According to National Aids Control Organization (NACO) statistics of 2013-14, Jharkhand has over 18,000 HIV positive patients. \"Migration is an issue which is beyond our control. We can only monitor the migrants' health,\" Akhtar added. These statistics come amid a host of intervention programmes being organized by the state health, education and family welfare department with assistance from the Centre, which includes providing condoms at subsidized rates from counters under the National Aids Control Program (NACP).

India too has many issues with medication and finances for HIV control programmes; many patient groups throughout 2015 complained out drug stockouts that resulted in the most vulnerable patients not getting their medicines continuously as prescribed. In a research paper that appeared in the BMJ Open on Sunday, the researchers calculated that the price tag for providing long-term HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment in 2015-2050 in the nine sub-Saharan countries most affected by the epidemic ranges from $98 billion at current coverage levels to $261 billion if coverage is scaled up. \"The HIV epidemic is far from over,\" said first author Rifat Atun, professor of global health systems, in a press release sent by the school of public health. \"The magnitude of funding needed to sustain the HIV fight is very large and the consequences of complacency even larger.\" Atun and colleagues looked at the nine countries that account for 70% of the HIV burden in Africa\u2014Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. \"They modeled these countries\u2019 HIV/AIDS funding needs through 2050, based on four different scenarios of coverage levels, using data from Spectrum, a publicly available tool used by UNAIDS,\" said the release. The researchers say that \u2018front-loading\u2019 investments now will be necessary to ensure that higher levels of coverage are achieved. This would ultimately reduce HIV transmission and future funding obligations. Domestic financing, the most important source of funding for HIV, will not be sufficient to meet future obligations, so new, innovative sources of funding will be necessary to both maintain and expand treatment and prevention. \"The problem of predictable and sustainable funding must be resolved,\" said Atun, noting in the paper that, \"There is an ethical responsibility to continue financing for those receiving ART, and not abandon them to death.\""}

Therefore most cases that are lost to follow-up are during these initial months,\" Dr Kedar Mehta, said researcher .The counselling sessions also include the family members of the patients in an attempt to minimize the stigma which experts believe still remain the major challenge for the treatment of the viral infection.Mehta added that stigmatisation of HIV/AIDS patients also cause many patients to stop their treatment. \"Many HIV positive patients hide their illness from relatives. As a result they do not take the regular medicines to avoid the questions,\" Mehta told TOI.According to previous studies conducted at the ART centre of the hospital, each year 19 per cent of the patients go missing after the first few sessions, leaving the treatment half way."}

India has the third-highest number of people with HIV in the world with number of those infected by the deadly virus standing at 21.17 lakh. Although HIV epidemic in the country is slowing down with a 19% decline in new HIV infections (130,000 in 2013) and a 38% decline in AIDS-related deaths between 2005 and 2013, the proportion of people who do not have access to antiretroviral therapy treatment is still very high at around 64%. Agreeing to hear a PIL for setting up hospitals exclusively for treatment of HIV-infected patients in every district, a bench of Justices J S Khehar and C Nagappan issued notice to Centre seeking its response. The court passed the order on a petition filed by senior advocate Paramananda Katara who contended that every HIV- infected patient must be provided antiretroviral therapy at affordable price immediately after the diagnosis to stop the deadly virus from multiplying. At the end of 2013, only 7 lakh people were on antiretroviral therapy, the second largest number of people on such treatment in any country.\"Helpless patients suffering with HIV/AIDS are dying all over the country as there are no exclusive hospitals to deal with this disease. There are no HIV-testing centres in rural areas and it leads to spread of the virus. It is a fundamental duty of the Centre and state governments to provide immediate medical treatment to HIV/AIDS patients,\" he told the bench. Contending that prisoners and sex workers are more prone to being affected by the virus, the petitioner contended that testing centres must be set up in jail premises and red light areas.HIV prevalence in the country is estimated at 0.3%. This figure is small compared to most other middle-income countries in the world but because of huge population this equates to more than 21 lakh people living with HIV.

She set up a number of AIDS prevention education information centres and funded the education of 50 little boys from disadvantaged sections of the society from Sanguem. At the ongoing HIV Congress in the capital city, Du Boisrouvray was conferred with the meritorious service award for her invaluable contribution for the care and support of people living with HIV/AIDS. Health reasons prevented her from personally receiving the award but she told STOI from Portugal that she was humbled and touched that her work received recognition. She recalled the time when HIV/AIDS was still taboo and AIDS orphans were not even recognized in the state. \"There was a lot of ignorance surrounding the transmission of AIDS and nobody wanted to even touch aids orphans. It was an upstream battle,\" she told STOI.FXB was one of the first NGOs invited by the National AIDS control organization, part of the Indian ministry of health and family welfare and was also granted official status by the Indian government in 1999 to organize HIV and AIDS prevention activities in the slum areas around Jaipur city. Du Boisrouvray was instrumental in getting May 7 recognized as World AIDS Orphans Day after she presented UN secretary general Kofi Annan with two million signatures in support of the day. FXB's integrated community-based village programme gives a grant to participants to set up a business and decreases its investment over three years as revenues and savings of participants increase. \"When we started, I rejected the then vogue for micro-credit as a solution to global poverty as it was clear to me that the extreme poor would never be able to provide a sufficient return to repay loans,\" says the former journalist and designer who also set up her own film production company in the past.FXB India Suraksha is looking to start new programs to fight cross border trafficking in Manipur in the North East, Myanmar and China.

A division bench comprising justice Bhushan Gavai and justice Swapna Joshi issued notices to NMC commissioner and other four respondents asking him to reply by Saturday, when the next hearing is fixed. Petitioner \u2014 Nagari Hakka Saurakhshan Manch through its president Janardhan Moon \u2014 has filed a PIL (No. 2054/2016) contending that leader of ruling party in NMC has organized the event where \u2018Hanuman Chalisa\u2019 would be chanted and due to that citizens from other religions will not be able to participate. His counsel Ashwin Ingole said sentiments of those from other religions would be hurt as menace of AIDS was not restricted to any single community, but spread globally. Ingole argued that people from all religions are entitled to participate in the programme as per Constitutional right offered to them under Article 25. Hence chanting of \u2018Hanuman Chalisa\u2019 would severely affect their rights. Moreover, the organizers are also spending precious taxpayers money of Rs50 lakh on it, instead of utilizing it for a good cause.

On Saturday, the standing committee meet passed the proposal of NMC\u2019s public works department to spend 16.86 lakh for organizing the event. Standing panel chairman Sudhir Raut clarified that NMC would not spend a single penny on the religious function. \u201cWe would be using the platform to create Aids awareness programme,\u201d he said. The standing panel cleared another 10 proposals pertaining to various developmental works including giving administrative approval to hike the maintenance and operation costs of traffic signals. Shockingly, the panel ignored the abnormal revision of operation and maintenance cost by the electrical department. Though the officials concerned are neglecting maintenance of traffic signals, the nod would increase the annual operation and maintenance cost of these signals by 31.87%. The NMC\u2019s electrical department has proposed to increase operation and maintenance cost of 148 traffic signals and blinkers to 87.44 lakh from 66.31 lakh. \u201cThe contract for annual operation and maintenance of automatic traffic signals and blinkers with M/s Decofurn Constructions expired on March 11.

He, however, could not explain why NMC was increasing maintenance cost every year even as traffic signals remained neglected. According to traffic police, around 50 traffic signals are defunct for months. \u201cAt least, 30 others have developed snags or faults due to lack of maintenance,\u201d said a head traffic constable. The cop added that the contractor had done a shoddy job and wondered why NMC is increasing the operation and maintenance cost. Sources said M/s Decofurn Constructions, which first got contract for maintenance of traffic signals for 17 lakh per annum in 2010, has often got flak for poor performance. In June 2015, the standing committee approved administration\u2019s proposal to revise the firm\u2019s contract to 66.31 lakh per annum from 30 lakh per annum in the previous year.

Raut claimed that the process to construct public toilets for women in commercial places was in final stage. In the first stage, the NMC would construct public toilets near Maharajbagh, Siraspeth and Prajapati Nagar.

Some 250 NGOs and organizations in the city have assured participation, he said. To get the correct figure of number of people on the ground, counting machines have been installed at every entry point. \u201cThe machines are similar to those set up at Gajanan Maharaj temple in Shegaon. They will keep track of every entry and exit to get the correct number,\u201d Tiwari said. Loya Bagri & Company, a chartered accountant firm, has been appointed to audit the event. Streetplays organized by MSAC will be held on the stage set up at the venue. City based medico and AIDS expert Dr Milind Bhursudi will give a Powerpoint presentation on AIDS. As directed by the court, Hanuman Chalisa event will be held one hour after the NMC programme concludes. Tiwari said NMC would bear the cost of only the AIDS awareness event and the cost of the religious event will be borne by Poddareshwar Ram Mandir. He evaded the question of how this cost would be calculated as the people will already be gathered at the venue under the programme organized by NMC. Tiwari put the cost of holding the event at around Rs16 lakh. Excited about the two events in which he would be taking part, Swapnil Shamkuwar, a social worker, said that it was a matter of city\u2019s pride as it was staking claim for a world record. \u201cBack to back we will be taking an oath for leading a disciplined life and then worshipping Hanuman, a symbol of service and discipline. I think it is a wonderful idea,\u201d says Chetan Kayarkar, a builder. Looking forward to the event, college lecturer Varsha Bhisikar says this is a very positive initiative for creating health awareness. \u201cChanting Hanuman Chalisa along with more than one lakh people is once in a lifetime opportunity and I will be there to do that.\u201d"}

Malik became part of Mylan in 2007 when the latter acquired India-based Matrix Laboratories, where he was CEO. That deal also transformed Mylan, which till then operated only in the US, into one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). On a recent visit to Bengaluru, Malik spoke to TOI:We know India has become a key part of your operations. Can you give us some quantitative measures of that?Out of a global workforce of 35,000 employees, more than 15,000 are based out of this country \u2014 1,800 of them are involved in R&D. We have the corporate team for emerging markets in India that determines which are the new countries we want to expand to, what are the strategies we need to adopt and so on. Today, Mylan\u2019s manufacturing platform includes more than 40 facilities, 25 of which are located in India. Those include all nine of our API facilities, eight of our OSD (oral solid doses) facilities, and eight of our injectable facilities, which manufacture our high quality medicines for markets all over the world, including emerging markets.You said you have a large R&D team here. Has this team delivered good innovations?Absolutely. Our commercial businesses based in India market high quality APIs to third parties around the world and anti-retroviral (ARV) products for people living with HIV/AIDS. Today, nearly 50% of those receiving treatment for HIV/AIDS in the developing world rely on a Mylan product, all of which are made by us in India. In fact, Mylan is India\u2019s third largest pharmaceutical exporter. Some think developing generic drugs involves zero or little R&D. But that\u2019s far from the truth.We were second to enter the US in the marketing of a generic version of AstraZeneca\u2019s heartburn drug Nexium, but we still managed to build a market share of 35-40% (the first mover typically has a huge advantage). That product was made from our facility in Nashik in Maharashtra. We were once the top API supplier to Cipla for HIV drugs but now we have more products than them. Due to our end-toend play, we have been able to bring the costs of such drugs down to $100 from $10,000.How do you see the patent environment in India?I think India has done a good job in balancing the idea of affordability and protection of science. India respects the basic molecule and it\u2019s a fair play as you need generics to reach millions of people.What are the major new drugs in the pipeline?A lot of work is going on in the field of oncology, diabetes and Hepatitis C. We were one of the licensing partners of Gilead from India to market its blockbuster drug Sovaldi for Hepatitis C in 94 countries. That pushed down the price of the drug to $900 from $84,000. People from Australia, New Zealand and Europe are coming to India to buy the drug due to its affordability."}

The 35-year-old terminally ill Naswadi resident from Chhota Udepur district is an AIDS patient and developed abdominal tuberculosis along with a number of viral infections. She is among those many victims who never found a chance to live normally through anti-retroviral treatment (ART). Radha was diagnosed with AIDS after her skin started erupting into lesions due to a viral infection. While her husband and son subsequently tested HIV positive, she became a victim of social stigmatization because of the very visible effects of her multiple disorders.The prevalence of HIV-AIDS patients in the tribal region poses a great hurdle in controlling the transmission of the virus and registration of new cases, doctors at the SSG Hospital claim. According to records of patients coming to SSG for ART and their follow-ups, many families with multiple HIV positive members exist in the tribal areas, most of whom are not diagnosed early. This is leading them to perpetuate the ongoing HIV epidemic.\"Radha's 42-year-old husband left her to fend for herself and their son and she gradually stopped her treatment. Unfortunately, cases like hers are common in the tribal belts. There is a majority of patients who discontinue their treatments posing a threat of spreading the virus,\" said Dr Y S Marfatia, head of department of skin and venereal diseases at SSG Hospital, \"Adolescent health programmes are yet to make an impact on the population that is largely illiterate. Most HIV carriers are unaware of their condition and spread the disease to their spouses and then children. We devote in a lot of time to convince patients to take the test. HIV virus can stay in the human body without causing any trouble for years, but the infection can be transmitted to another person,\" said Dr Mohammed Hussain, who handles HIV patients at SSG Hospital.The department is working towards 'Getting to Zero: zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination, and zero AIDS related deaths' - in an attempt to bring down the cases of failure to follow-up and last stage detections."}

Out of this, 1.5% of the cases were due to intravenous usage.So rampant have been the cases that chief minister Tarun Gogoi recently expressed concern over the menace and even asked the chief secretary to constitute a 'task force' headed by the additional chief secretary.IDU groups are categorised as high risk groups (HRGs) among other HRGs like 'men having sex with men' (MSM) and 'female sex workers' (FSW). IDU groups alone comprise 1.46% of the concentration of HIV epidemic as compared to 1.4% for MSM, and 0.46% for FSW, as per the HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) data from 2010-11 to 2015.\"The new cases of injecting users being reported from the city are quite worrisome.

However, the trend is upward in Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh.The rate of increase in new HIV infections annually is the highest in Assam and Tripura.

Reason? There is severe fund crunch with the government curtailing the budget.

For the years 2014 to 2016, the budget has been cut from Rs 1,700 crore to Rs 1,300 crore. This has affected the HIV/AIDS control programme. A portion of the fund is diverted to Swachh Bharat and skill development programmes.Earlier, the training centre for counsellors used to get funds from abroad routed through the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) under the global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria project.

Not only for this project, but for other educational projects too, we find the funds not forthcoming and on enquiry find that part of UGC funds gets diverted for skill development and Swachh Bharat.\"Even the State AIDS Control Society officials admitted to the shortage of funds for the last two years and reduction in NACO budget. A SACS official said, \"The new government doesn't encourage international donors like UNICEF and global funds and NACO had to undergo a budget cut in 2014-16 period of Rs 400 crore. The various SACS used to get funds directly from NACO but even that was discontinued and SACS had to get them through government treasury.

The idea was that the OTs after such surgeries would be properly fumigated the next day being a Sunday before being used for surgeries on non-HIV patients on Monday onwards till Friday. Asked if PMCH had slotted a specific day for surgeries on patients with HIV, PMCH superintendent Dr Lakhindra Prasad replied in the negative. He, however, told TOI earlier this week, \"Surgeries are performed on patients with HIV as and when required.\" Persons with HIV apart, even their children remain a neglected lot. All persons with HIV and their children are given anti-retroviral drugs to prevent the virus in their body from multiplying. Children are prescribed special drugs for the purpose. However, many ART centres have reported non-availability of these drugs with them. Sources on Thursday told TOI the drugs for such children are out of stock at the ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centres at Darbhanga Medical College & Hospital in Darbhanga and Anugrah Narain Magdh Medical College & Hospital in Gaya. At the government medical college and hospital in Bhagalpur, only 15 days' stock is left. Experts say this can be dangerous. \"Missing the dose leads to further weakening of the immune system... Also, the virus could become stronger than the drug whenever it is given next,\" said Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, former member of the Bihar State Aids Control Society (BSACS). Senior BSACS official B Gupta admits the shortage of drugs. \"We are not getting supplies from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO). We are managing things by supplying drugs from one centre to another,\" Gupta told TOI on Thursday. However, NACO's national programme officer B B Rewari blamed it on the state. \"From our end, the supply flow is perfect. The problem is with the state supply chain to districts,\" he said."}

Kaur, teaches science at a Government Girls Senior Secondary School in Janakpuri. She\u2019s been bringing odds and ends from home to the summer workshop for teachers at Shaheed Amir Chand Government Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, near Kashmere Gate, daily -- used soft-drink bottles, batteries, bits of insulated wire, empty tablet blister packs and a drawer-slide.Science teachers have use for everything. Safety-pins are especially valuable. Kaur already uses much of the rubbish she collects in class but for the drawer-slide, a few more put their heads together. They devised a rudimentary scale to explain spring action using the slide, a rubber band, strip of paper and safety-pin. Delhi Government has organised the summer workshops to help teachers do just this sort of thing more often -- create support material and teaching aids independently, with bits and bobs teachers and students can get their hands on easily. This is part of the government's efforts to improving learning. \u201cWe generally use waste material. These activities can help explain things in the classroom without having to run to the laboratory,\u201d said Kiran Tokas, a guest teacher now serving as mentor teacher. Social science teachers are using the game of Chinese whispers to impress upon children the problems of historiography.Throught the summer, the 200 mentor teachers will serve as \u201cfacilitators\u201d for roughly 24,000 government school trained graduate teachers (TGTs). In batches of about 40 -- two \u2018facilitators\u2019 to a batch -- seven rounds of workshops of four days each will be conducted at nine venues. At Amir Chand SKV, 617 science and social science teachers -- 15 batches -- completed the workshop on Thursday and were even paid a visit by the eudcation minister, Manish Sisodia.Each batch will cover a part of the syllabus, contributing toward a common repertory of lesson plans, activities and support material designs that can be replicated by others.Replication, however, is easier discussed at workshops than done. The science teachers of SKV Kakrola put together a lesson-plan involving cotton-balls, two sheep characters (Baby Dolly and Mama Dolly), some knitting and weaving to transact the lesson on \u201cfibre to fabric\u201d. But they themselves concede that must of these activities demand far smaller class-sizes than what they deal with. Anita Lakra has 111 students in her class; another teacher has 128. \u201cThese are possible for class sizes of about 20, maximum 30. The average class-size for teachers here is over 60,\u201d observe Neeru Behl, from a SKV in Janakpuri. The teachers still try, through group activity and student leaders.This isn\u2019t the first workshop -- seminars and trainings are routine -- but the first where it\u2019s okay to hop across to check what another group\u2019s doing with its safety-pins. The standard-issue seminars repeat resource persons and are in \u201clecture-mode\u201d -- what the workshops are trying to get teachers to break out of."}

Sources from the RDMC blame rampant concretization as one of the major reasons for tree collapse incidents during monsoon. The last fiscal saw 423 trees fall and amongst these, a huge number of trees fell during the rains. As many as 182 trees fell in June while 123 collapsed in July. Sandeep Malvi, public relations officer of TMC, said, \u201cWe are taking adequate measures to trim trees regularly to prevent them from losing balance and collapsing.\u201d Experts, however, doubt if the civic body has learnt any lessons from the past incidents to curb further tree loss this year. \u201cWhen drainage work or ground work are undertaken, the roots of the trees get affected as they get cut. Due to this, they are not in proper position, which affects their balance. Also, one needs to check what effect random cutting of branches will have on trees,\u201d said Anjana Dewasthale, a city-based horticulturist. There were also incidents of branches collapsing apart from tree falls. Around 110 branches fell from April 2015 to March 2016. Thirty-five of these incidents were reported in June while 18 were recorded in July. \u201cDuring summer, many trees go dry, so they easily fall due to heavy rains or storms. Also, rain trees are affected with mealybugs, that are insects that feed on plant juices. They also act as a vector for several plant diseases. It is easier for branches that are affected by these insects to fall,\u201d she added. \u201cA survey should be done to understand which tree requires stability and balance,\u201d said Dewasthale."}

Today even a 90-year-old can contract the virus.\" The audience fell silent for a moment before breaking into applause. Despite the efforts of activists like Pokrovsky, the total number of registered HIV cases in Russia exceeded one million in late 2015, with authorities struggling to contain an epidemic that experts say could be curbed by increased funding and more awareness campaigns. Pokrovsky has been openly critical of the Kremlin's policies promoting traditional family values, saying they have failed to halt the spread of the deadly virus. \"In 2015 alone, some 100,000 new HIV cases were reported in Russia,\" Pokrovsky told AFP. \"This is a very high rate, maybe the highest in Europe.\" The Russian government's policy focuses on treatment while neglecting prevention drives such as sex education in schools, with the number of people infected with the virus soaring as a result, say experts. A public health campaign in Moscow last year urged people to be faithful to their partners, rather than promoting condom use. \"Young people here often don't even know what HIV is and don't understand its dangers,\" said Moscow-based student Darya Belimova who joined Pokrovsky to address more than a thousand young people at the conference. The gathering was part of the \"Stop HIV/AIDS\" prevention campaign spanning more than 200 universities. Although the Russian health and education ministries support \"Stop HIV/AIDS\", activists and volunteers say they are fighting a lonely battle against Russia's AIDS epidemic as the virus increasingly affects the heterosexual population. The World Health Organization last year said that Russia accounted for 60 percent of all HIV diagnoses in Europe in 2014, with heterosexual sex the main route of transmission of the virus which is spread through contact with contaminated body fluids. The number of HIV-positive minors which stood at 9,792 in 2015 has also jumped 8.5 percent compared to the previous year. In most of these cases an HIV-positive mother transmitted the virus to the child at birth, said Pokrovsky. \"In Russia, there is not enough public financing to support the fight against HIV at a national scale, and HIV prevention programmes for drug addicts practically don't exist,\" he said. There are just a few dozen NGOs working to fight the epidemic, spread across 40 Russian cities. \"For Russia, this is a very small number,\" Pokrovsky said. Organizations like the Andrey Rylkov Foundation which runs an outreach programme for drug users in Moscow, handing out clean needles and condoms receive no government funding. The vast size of the country also presents a challenge for effective prevention, with far-flung corners of the federation like Siberia particularly badly affected. Russia also bans methadone replacement therapy for drug addicts, which would allow users to avoid injections, eliminating the risk of contracting the virus from contaminated syringes. Many Russian NGOs, including those working on HIV prevention among drug addicts, have been under increased pressure since the reelection of President Vladimir Putin to a third term in 2012. Shortly after he was sworn in once again, the government passed a law allowing authorities to brand groups engaging in broadly-defined \"political activity\" that receive foreign funding as \"foreign agents\". The legislation was passed soon after huge anti-Putin protests rocked Moscow, and Kremlin critics see the law as a way to muzzle the strongman's critics and tighten his grip on power. In April, a court ordered that Sotsium, an HIV prevention NGO based in the southwestern city of Saratov, be labelled \"foreign agents\" after it received 1.5 million rubles ($22,400) in foreign funding to conduct a survey among drug addicts and people with HIV. \"Until recently, society wasn't really aware of the magnitude of the problem,\" said Sergei Smirnov, vice-chair of the Foundation for Social and Cultural Initiatives, the organization behind the \"Stop HIV/AIDS\" campaign. If the growth of HIV infections remains steady until 2021, Russia will face a so-called \"generalized epidemic,\" the foundation warns. An epidemic becomes \"generalized\" when HIV prevalence exceeds one percent in pregnant women nationwide, Pokrovsky said. \"This rate now stands at 0.8 percent,\" he said. \"But if it increases, the risk of a serious epidemic is very high.\""}

City-based technologists Anurag Sharma and Paresh Patel have developed an app called Q+ Hearing Aid to help those with hearing disabilities. They say that it can get rid of the hassles of carrying hearing aids, changing batteries and the social stigma of being seen with one. Q+ uses mobile technology to enable the hearing impaired customize their listening experience by using results of a simple, interactive hearing test. Sharma and Patel, both IIT alumni, began developing it three years ago, soon after they launched Quadio Devices Pvt Ltd in 2009.Sharma said that the app first judges the level of hearing loss and then, processes all sounds accordingly and sends it through a compatible earphone to the user. Headsets or earphones which have a microphone would catch the sound or conversation, and send it to the app for processing. In case of group conversations, the user can hear if a person speaks slightly close to the phone's microphone. If headsets or earphones without microphones are used, then the phone's microphone would automatically switch on and the app's noise reducing algorithm will work to render clean and legible sounds.Anurag Sharma said that the headsets which come with the phone would be most suitable for the best sound quality as they have been calibrated accordingly. \"Though any headset can be used, if a third-party earphone is used, the sound quality would be slightly reduced. In the future, we would include support for third-party headsets as well,\" he said.The idea for this app was floated by Patel, who had suffered hearing loss due to an overdose of Malaria medicines when he was young. With age, Patel realized that the hearing loss only increased, leading to gaps in communication. Sharma, whose father also suffered from hearing loss, joined him and the two began the development of what they call a \"disruptive technology\". \"The phone can now work as a hearing aid and moreover, there are settings which can be used to alter the quality of voice as per the environment whether indoors or outdoors,\" Sharma said. He added that it can be used effectively by people who suffer from moderate to severe hearing loss, for one-on-one conversations or even group meetings. The user, however, would not be able to access phone calls during that time as mobile operating systems do not allow apps access to calls.Sharma explained that Q+ uses various algorithms which Quadio has developed. \"There is an algorithm which amplifies the sound according to each individual's hearing loss at the respective required frequencies. Another algorithm then handles the amplification and ensures it is not too loud, so as to not lead to further hearing loss. The background noise is cut out through a noise reduction algorithm.\"\"Going forward, we would also include a music player in the app, which would access the phone's library and act just like a music player in other cases,\" Sharma said.Senior citizen Gopal Deshpande (83) has been using the app for almost a year, since its beta phase. He said he has decided not to go back to his hearing aid. \"In old age, we often become forgetful and we have to carry hearing aid devices apart from mandatory mobile phones. It becomes a problem if one of them is left behind. With this app, only a cellphone is needed and it allows me to adjust settings according to the environment. The settings on hearing aids are delicate and handling them is tough for a person of my age.\"Deshpande said that it was initially awkward to use the app, but so was using the hearing aid. when he started using one and was teased by friends. \"But later I realised that most youngsters these days have earphones plugged in their ears all day, and people did not notice much if I did the same,\" Deshpande said.The app is currently available for use on iPhone 4s and above and Android phones with Android Lollypop or higher on iTunes and GooglePlay. Around 100 users, with some from outside India, have already downloaded the app.Sharma said that in low-end Android phones, the sound lag is quite a bit with as much as 300 milliseconds in some cases. \"Humans can identify lags beyond 50 milliseconds, hence as of now the app works smoothly with good hardware and software where the lag is less and we need Android 5 and above version for this,\" he explained.Sharma added that Q+ is the only app which does proper calibration and works according to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) norms of audiometry.Q+ comes in two versions Pro and Lite. The Lite version is available for free, while Pro is available for a one-time payment of Rs 500."}

The finding assumes significance as most blood banks, hospitals and transfusion centres use ELISA as a gold standard to detect HIV. The virus in the two city women could finally be detected using the PCR test that is occasionally used to test HIV. The Parel-based National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH) had come across the cases in 2012, when the women were referred from JJ Hospital with a history of co-infection. The revelation comes within days of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) stating that 2,234 people have contracted HIV across the country through transfusion of infected blood in the past one-and-a-half years. In Maharashtra, 276 people have got HIV through infected blood. The point here is not to say that ELISA is unreliable but that there is a possibility of missing out infected bility of missing out infected cases. In both cases, the antibodies did not appear for two years,\u201c said Dr Atmaram Bandivadekar, consultant at NIRRH. HIV antibodies are generated by the body's immune system when under attack from the virus. Tests like ELISA check for the presence of antibodies to say if a person is infected or not. \u201cDifferent individuals can take varying time to generate antibodies, but two years is too long,\u201c he said. Bandivadekar said that PCR could be a more accurate alternative. \u201cThis test finds either the RNA of the HIV virus or the HIV DNA in cells infected with the virus. The test can be done within days of exposure as one does not have to worry about the window period,\u201c he added. In an ELISA test, there is a window period of one to three months depending on whether the technology is from the first or fourth generation. The husbands of both these women were HIV positive and were taking the antiretro viral therapy at JJ Hospital.Doctors at the hospital became curious when the women frequently came with some ailment despite repeatedly testing negative for HIV . They stopped following up with the institute after two years. But staunch ELISA supporters are not willing to write off the test yet. \u201cIt has been proved beyond doubt that this test has a low chance of giving a false result after the first few weeks that a person is infected.The world over, it is the first line of screening. If ELISA is negative, other tests are not usually repeated,\u201c said a microbiologist. Though if ELISA comes positive, the test is repeated to confirm the findings.\u201cPCR may be reliable but it is expensive and needs expertise,\u201c the doctor added. Bandivadekar felt all blood banks should have the PCR technology.

For 72 hours, Kulsumbi was nervous and harboured thoughts of committing suicide. She was worried about her family of five young children and her spouse, a tiles labourer who earned very little. The family of Sayad Eqbal Ahmed Jamadar heaved a sigh of relief after a second medical test conducted three days later - at a government hospital - said she is in the clear. Sharing the trauma of those three days, Sayad Eqbal Ahmed Jamadar said his wife had a growth on her hand and a government doctor suggested she undergo a routine blood test to ascertain if she has any vitamin deficiency. The worried couple went to a private lab in Haveri on Monda. Thanks to a mix-up by the lab, the woman received a report that declared her HIV positive. The Jamadar family was too shocked to rush to another lab for a second test. \"I was traumatized and found it extremely difficult to convince my wife that we can seek a second opinion. She was depressed, spoke of committing suicide by hanging as she didn't want to live with the stigma of HIV. I made several attempts to keep hope,\" Sayad pointed out. That was when the couple decided to seek the counsel of family friend Khader. He suggested an immediate second test and reprimanded Jamadar's wife for contemplating suicide based on \"a random test\". Jamadar said: \"On Khader's advice, we went to the Haveri government hospital on Wednesday for a test, this time to rule out presence of HIV in her bloodstream. To our great relief, she tested negative for HIV. We are extremely happy, and equally angry with the private lab for the costly blooper.\" The family brought the issue to the district health officer's notice, seeking action against the lab. When Jamadar confronted laboratory officials, they admitted to the lapse and claimed a faulty medical kit would have thrown the HIV result in a routine blood test. He is contemplating filing a case against the lab. Haveri district surgeon Mahesh Badni blamed the lab for the horrendous mix-up. District health officer Sunil Chandra Avaradi held the lab responsible for the goof-up, and said no hospital or medical facility informs a patient of HIV test results. He said his department will conduct a probe into the incident and punish the guilty. A technician from the Haveri lab who didn't wish to be identified apologized for the mistake."}

She went through the mandatory blood tests before surgery and everything was fine barring a low haemoglobin level. A blood transfusion done at the hospital to improve her platelet count, however, changed the course of her life for the worse.Though she was not operated upon in that period, she was given one unit of blood and asked to come back in five days by which time the Hb percentage was expected to improve. What followed came as a total shock. Subsequently, when Gowri came back for admission and after another round of blood tests, the results said: Reactive to HIV 1. And the interpretation was screaming: \"The above sample was repeatedly reactive for HIV I and II antibodies by three different test methods and therefore positive for HIV as per NACO guidelines.\"The family was caught unawares. Not even a week prior to this second blood test, her sample showed HIV negative, in the same laboratory, of the same hospital. The hospital, which denied the allegations, reportedly told the family that Gowri was already infected before she came to them. It's been two years since her diagnosis and Gowri is on medication; her family has approached the Karnataka Medical Council and is fighting a case in the magistrate's court. The issue was brought before the state health department, and a committee was formed, but it did not see any action. A petition moved by V S Ugrappa, chairman of the expert committee on preventing sexual violence against women and children, has set the ball rolling with the police taking up the case.The complaint was filed recently at Sadashivnagar police station against the hospital, a gynaecologist, and two employees of the Integrated Counselling and Testing Center for cognisable offence of \"forgery with medical records and medical negligence\".\"It is submitted that the accused hospital is involved in gross medical negligence by causing HIV infection via contaminated blood transfusion. Thereafter, the accused have tampered with the medical records to cover up the crime. The chain of events shows that within all human probability, the offence of forgery of medical records to conceal evidence of medical negligence. This complaint may be specially taken in record and speedily acted upon, because of the gravity of the crime, the maneuvers of the other side to hush up matters and cause great harm to me and my family,'' the complaint has stated.The major offences recorded are: Forgery of medical record (IPC section 466); cheating (420); forgery (463), making a false document (464). Subsequently, the police have taken up an FIR and investigations are on -- they are examining the medical records and have questioned the hospital staff and the doctor.Documents show that on February 13, 2014, Gowri was admitted to the hospital and discharged on the 15th. Her discharge summary says that her Hb% is 7.5m, platelet count 2.29; VDRL, HIV I & II negative and one unit of blood transfusion was advised. Accordingly, on the 14th, one unit (300 ml of RBC) was given (blood unit number 17093 for which the family has the record) and on the 15th she was discharged and asked to come back on the 19th.Subsequently, on February 19, Gowri was again admitted and the same set of blood tests were carried out. And this time the results were: Hb% 10.2, platelet count 2.23 and HIV I & II negative (in fact it is very unclear and looks like a scribble). The discharge summary read: \"Patient came with the above mentioned complaints, diagnosed to be Retro Positive and counseling done. Hence discharged on February 22.'' Surprisingly, the blood unit number was changed to 12093 in the hospital records.The patient gave another sample for testing at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Center on February 24 which also showed her positive for HIV. Intriguingly, the same Center has another record to show that on February 12, Gowri's sample was tested and came back HIV positive. But the catch is that Gowri was admitted to MS Ramaiah only on February 13, hence where did this blood test come from. The family sees something amiss. \"This is a fraudulent document. When my sister was admitted on 13th and her blood sample drawn for testing at MS Ramaiah, why would she go for blood tests on the 12th? This document was created subsequently to show that the patient was infected before she was admitted. But the hospital's first discharge summary says that the blood tests are negative for HIV. This has to be investigated thoroughly,'' said the patient's husband Rajanna (name changed).MS Ramaiah Hospital termed the issue an \"allegation\" and its chief administrator Dr V Narendranath, who did not want to divulge much on the case, said, \"It is in court and it is sub judice. We will respond to the court and give a reply to the appropriate authority. We respect our patients and we cannot divulge the patient's medical history. We will not breach the patient's confidentiality at any cost.\" Expressing his resentment over the police \"harassing the doctors and para-medical staff for four days\", Dr Narendranath says: \"Why is this a criminal case? These days, hospitals have become a soft target. Every patient has a right to express his/her grievance and somebody has to decide what is right and what is wrong.\" Why the mess?For a start, MS Ramaiah Hospital doesn't come under the state government's Individual Donor Nucleic Acid Testing (ID-NAT) project where blood is tested at the highest standard. The normal process followed for testing of donated blood in private blood banks in hospitals is the Elisa test, which detects Hepatitis B and C and HIV for antigens and antibodies. However, under ID-NAT, the blood sample is tested for HIV, HBV (Hepatitis B) and HCV (Hepatitis C) to detect direct Ribo Nucleic Acid and DNA of the virus. All government hospital bloodbanks and Rotary-TTK are a part of this project where donated blood is mandatorily tested by ID-NAT. This test is done at Bowring Hospital, the only certified blood testing facility.According to specialists, a virus, after entering the bloodstream, has a window period and only after that can the antigens or antibodies be detected. HIV has a lower window period than HBV or HCV -- around 15-20 days. In case an HIV-infected person donates blood and the window period is just four to five days, the virus will go undetected and there is a fair chance that it could infect the person undergoing the blood transfusion."}

The patient, a 45-year-old man from northeast, has been living with HIV since 2003. He contracted Hepatitis C leading to liver failure. The family of the patient said the local hospitals they approached had given up, saying there was no cure for this complex condition. So, they rushed him to Delhi where the transplant was carried out. \u201cIt took us over 10 hours to carry out the life-saving procedure. We had to be very careful not to catch the infection. At the same time, we had to ensure that the patient didn\u2019t contract any infection post transplant,\u201d said Dr Naimish Mehta, senior liver transplant surgeon at SGRH. He said HIV patients are generally not taken up for major surgeries, particularly transplants, because they are immune-compromised. \u201cIn this case, for example, the patient had both HIV and Hepatitis C, which compromised his immunity significantly. Additionally, we had to suppress his immune system post transplant to ensure that the body doesn\u2019t reject the new liver,\u201d Mehta said. The liver transplant surgeon added that this was a huge challenge for them and any misstep could have proved fatal. The liver transplant surgeon said both the donor and the recipient were doing well. In India, 2.1 million people are living with HIV and Hepatitis C virus co-infection, said Dr Anil Arora, chairman, department of gastroenterology at the hospital. He added that initially HIV infection was considered an absolute contraindication for organ transplants because of concerns about disease progression. However, with recent advances in retro-viral therapy for HIV and treatment for Hepatitis C virus infection, complex procedures, including transplants, can be carried out, the doctor added. The US Congress recently passed HIV Organ Policy Equity Act (HOPE Act), which allows organ donation between HIV positive individuals. \u201cThe prevalence of liver disease in patients with HIV is higher than that of the general population, as are the morbidity and mortality. But with successful transplant, it is possible to give them a new life,\u201d Arora added. According to the doctor, in India, the biggest hurdle for patients suffering from HIV is the stigma associated with this disease. In many areas, HIV positive people are considered social outcasts. Worse, they are turned away by many hospitals too. \u201cIn spite of medical advances, these patients find themselves condemned for life,\u201d said another senior doctor at Gangaram hospital."}

We have sent orders for him (Radhakrishnan) to be given the connection on Monday morning on a special case,\" he said. Trouble for the couple and their two daughters dates back to in the neighbourhood in 2011 when their thatched house was set on fire. and they along with their two daughters escaped with minor injuries. Radhakrishnan had then filed a complaint with police against the former Thirumani panchayat president, late V Rajagopal, who wanted the family to vacate the village because of the couple's HIV-positive status. Chengalpet police had registered a case of attempt to murder.Radhakrishnan had said that the miscreants had locked the house from outside and set fire to it at 2.30 am because he refused to listen to village leaders' diktat that they go away from the village. Radhakrishnan, 45 was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1995. \"The former panchayat leader had put us through a lot of problems but we protested and built our own house and stayed here,\" he says.Activists in the state say that the government's campaign to sensitise people to HIV has fizzled out. \"There has been no effort over the last three years to address stigma and discrimination associated with HIV,\" says Krishnagiri-based G Karunanidhi, founder, HIV Positive Network. \"There is no budget allocated for support and care.\""}

The NGOs are now facing difficulties in arranging community meetings of patients as the staff does not have funds to provide them food or medicines.\"Our NGO is taking care of around 2,100 HIV positive patients under three different projects. We have not received a penny since April. The conditions were bad since the past 18 months, but have become worse now. We are facing troubles paying salaries to our staff. The staff members are the only point of contact for HIV positive patients. If we lose the staff, it clearly means we have lost contact with the patient,\" said Shivaji Dhone, programme manager of Muslim Samaj Prabodhan Shikshan Santha, one of the prominent NGOs working in the HIV sector.An official of another NGO Sakhi Sanghtana, which primarily communicates and sensitises female sex workers in Kolhapur and Ichalkaranji where HIV prevalence has been a concern for the past two decades, said the programmes for HIV patients have been severely affected because of lack of funds.\"The treatment process is getting affected as we do not have funds to procure medicines. We have received information from other NGOs in the state where the condition is similar or worse. Some of the NGO staff, who were living in the city on rent, have gone back to their native places. They can no longer afford to pay the rent.

It has affected budgeting of the programme across the country. The funding has almost halved,\" sources added.The dearth of funding in Kolhapur was reflected on Tuesday when collector Saini praised the district-level aids prevention and control unit for continuing the work despite lack of money.

Introducing Hepatitis, a viral infection that affects the liver and is a leading cause of death and disability across the world. The disease is backed by some startling facts. A recent study published in The Lancet journal stated that viral hepatitis deaths increased by 63 per cent in the last 23 years. For the uninitiated, there are five different types of viral hepatitis, namely A, B, C, D and E. All of them are contagious and some are life threatening too. Hepatitis A and E are waterborne; Hepatitis B, C and D are transmitted by bodily fluids (via syringes, needles, injections, toothbrush, razors). Furthermore, all of them are contagious and some are life threatening too. Dr. Ajay P Choksi, Consultant and Head, Dept. of Gastroenterology & Hepatology at Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital, Mumbai explains, \"Hepatitis A and E are generally self limiting and don't normally last beyond six months. However, they can be severe, incapacitating and fatal during this period. Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HBC), on the other hand, can give rise to acute illnesses like A (HBA) and E (HBE) but can also cause chronic liver disease, which can lead to cirrhosis of liver or even cancer of liver. Hepatitis D (HBD) infection occurs only if a person has Hepatitis B.\" Shockingly, there have been a surge in deaths in the past 20 years. \"Despite alarming statistics, we as a country have not undertaken enough clinical research. Of the five, there is no cure for three of them. Hepatitis C alone affects estimated 12 million people in India, most of whom don't even know they are carriers. The combined burden of viral hepatitis is huge in India. We need treatment regimens that are short and therapies that are effective, affordable and well-tolerated,\" shares Suneela Thatte, President, Indian Society of Clinical Research (ISCR). World Health Organisation has stated that a shocking 95 per cent of people infected with Hepatitis B or C do not even know they are infected and often live without symptoms for a long time. This year alone, 10 to 30 million people will be infected with HBV. Dr Harshwardhan Dongre, K J Somaiya Hospital warns, \"Currently there is no treatment for acute Hepatitis B infection. Progression to chronic disease depends on a host of factors, so preventing acute infection is the only preventive measure available.\" Dr. PM Bhujang \u2013 President, Association of Hospitals adds, \"Acute infection may present as fever, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting fever, abdominal pain, jaundice and dark urine. Chronic hepatitis may present with early and late symptoms of liver dysfunction and failure.\" Unlike Hepatitis B, C and D, Hepatitis A and E do not damage the liver in the long term. \"Once infected or vaccinated, we do not get the infection again,\" adds Dr Vasudevan K R, senior consultant, surgical gastroenterology and liver transplantation department, Jaypee Hospital, Noida. Prevention plan Most of the viral hepatitis have vaccinations and so the first plan should be to get yourself duly immunized against them. Follow the below guidelines: - Avoid sharing sharp objects for example, needles, razor and toothbrush. - Avoid unprotected sex. - Three dosages of hepatitis B vaccine given at intervals of 0-1-6 months would give immunity against Hepatitis B at more than 95% probability. - All infants should be immunised against hepatitis B in 1st year of life. - All pregnant ladies should be screened for hepatitis B & C and if found positive, adequate measures should be taken to prevent transmission. - No open wound should be contacted without gloves. Facts and myths Dr. Neeraj Saraf, Associate Director - Hepatology, Medanta - The Medicity lays busts some common myths Myths and facts of Hepatitis B Myths: People infected with viral hepatitis B never recover. Facts: Ninety percent of infected adults with acute hepatitis B can recover without any problems, but most infected babies and children eventually develop chronic hepatitis B infection, where recovery is not possible. New antiviral treatments may reduce the incidence of complications by suppressing the virus and preventing progression of the disease. Myths: Viral Hepatitis B cannot be prevented. Facts: The Viral Hepatitis B vaccine is absolutely safe and extremely effective. It only takes 3 shots to protect against viral hepatitis B. Myths and facts of Hepatitis C Myths: You\u2019ve been vaccinated for Hepatitis C Facts: No vaccine currently exists for hepatitis C therefore you cannot be vaccinated for hepatitis C. Myth: It is not curable Facts: Hepatitis C is almost 100 per cent curable with the help of the excellent drugs that are available"}

Although male sex workers (MSWs) come under the high-risk category under HIV intervention programmes, their names rarely make it to the list. The result is more than 25 years after the initiation of the country's AIDS control programme, most of them continue to engage in unsafe sex. A study by a group of researchers from institutes across the world, including the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT), Chennai, has found that 74.2% of the MSWs they surveyed accepted more money from their clients to not use a condom. The study, recently published in AIDS Care, took into account experiences of 100 male sex workers around the age of 25 years in the city. Beena Thomas, an NIRT scientist, who was part of the research, said at least three-fourth of the subjects surveyed expressed difficulty in convincing their clients to use condoms. \u201cThey find it hard to negotiate. And if sex work is their only source of income, it is likely that they agree to go forward without protection as the clients pay more,\u201c she said. The subjects said they earned between `2,000 and `8,000 a month. Although male sex workers are at a higher risk of contracting HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI), they remain understudied compared to their female peers. Experts attribute this to the stigma attached not just to sex work, but their sexual orientation as well. The study also noted that only 64% of them reported ever testing for HIV. Dr Sundar Sundararaman, a physician who has worked with HIV patients for the past 30 years, isn't surprised by these figures. He said while HIV intervention programmes have listed transgender, women sex workers and homosexual men under the high-risk category, they are yet to recognize male sex workers as an exclusive group. \u201cMale sex workers are not identified and so they aren't in the ambit of service delivery ,\u201c he said, advocating changes at the policy level. He said financial incentives for riskier sexual behaviour, coupled with lack of access to prevention services, increased prevalence of HIV and STIs among MSWs compared to broader population of men having sex with men. The study also noted that more than half of the subjects did not know the HIV status of their most recent client. As believed, it is not just women sex workers who face abuse. Researchers found 60% of the MSWs faced verbal abuse and 40% were physically assaulted. Those who financially depended only on sex work were far more vulnerable and likely to report abuse. Dr Vijaya Raman of Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative said the numbers were alarming and urgent steps needed to be taken for intervention programmes to reach this group. \u201cOur outreach programmes need to be revamped. This is an evolving sector. Previously , they operated in groups, now many of them work individually through the internet, which gives them anonymity,\u201c he said. The study threw another surprise highlighting the need to identify this group -nearly 72% said they wanted to continue sex work. \u201cThis being the case, HIV prevention interventions shouldn't try to draw MSWs away but focus on facilitating skills that will support their ability to negotiate sexual safety,\u201c said Thomas."}

Govt. to declare malaria notifiable disease soon At present, cases being treated at public hospitals are only taken into account to assess the disease burden. Putting every case on record is a crucial challenge in eliminating malaria which the country aims to achieve by 2030. This herbal combo packs powerful punch against colon cancer Curcumin is the active ingredient in the spice turmeric, which is present in spicy curry dishes, and silymarin is a component of milk thistle, which has been used to treat liver disease.

When we ask patients about what they ate last, the most common answer is non-vegetarian food at an eating joint\" Toxic bacteria found in seafood samples Over the past one year, around 123 samples of fish were taken and analyzed at the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT), which is a nationally-accredited agency by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for testing the quality of fish. Dirty water stunts millions of Indian children: Study Despite high economic growth in recent years, India has more stunted children than Nigeria, Pakistan, China and the Republic of Congo combined. Hepatitis: A disease that's deadlier than HIV For the uninitiated, there are five different types of viral hepatitis, namely A, B, C, D and E. All of them are contagious and some are life threatening too. Beware of tattoos, reused needles can cause Hepatitis C Recently, a 26-year-old techie was referred to Manipal Hospitals after a master check-up elsewhere showed his liver enzymes were alarmingly high. Blood test revealed the youth was suffering from Hepatitis C infection. There is antibiotic hiding out in people's noses Scientists in Germany have discovered a bacteria hiding out in peoples' noses that produces an antibiotic compound that can kill several dangerous pathogens, including the superbug MRSA. WHO alert - 52m hepatitis cases a burden on India This is placing a huge disease, social and economic burden on the affected families as well as the health system, the UN agency said. After-hours email expectations taking toll on employee health Responding to work emails after work hours may seem like an increase in productivity, but it turns out, it is negatively impacting employee well-being. Alcohol causes seven types of cancer: Study Excessive consumption of alcohol can lead to seven forms of cancer, and individuals consuming even low to moderate amounts are at risk, says a review. Sleep with chicken around bed and avoid malaria! A study done by scientists from Ethopia and Sweden has claimed that mosquitoes are repelled by the smell of chickens. New forms of HIV can jump from animals to humans The suggestion stems from a study in which the scientists discovered the first in vivo evidence that strains of chimpanzee-carried simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that virologists consider the ancestor of HIV can infect human cells. Drug combo may help fight antibiotic resistance Researchers have found that combinations of three different antibiotics can help overcome bacteria's resistance to antibiotics, even when none of the three antibiotics on their own, or even two of the three together, is effective. Researchers find way to prevent damage in donated kidneys Researchers have identified a panel of genes which can help predict whether a transplanted kidney will later develop fibrosis -- a condition which can cause the organ to fail. New compound may help fight epilepsy Researchers from Louisiana State University in the US, discovered and patented the compounds known as LAU that prevented the seizures and their damaging effects on dendritic spines in an experimental model of epilepsy in mice. Genetic switch identified to prevent asthma If successful, it's hoped that the advance could stop it at the origin of the disease. Remote-controlled microbots to soon aid doctors To better treat a variety of diseases, researchers have developed soft, flexible and motor-less microrobots that can be remotely controlled with electromagnetic fields. Zika risk at Rio Olympics 'low' In a worst-case scenario, an estimated 3 to 37 of the thousands of athletes, spectators, media and vendors traveling to Rio for the Olympics will bring the Zika virus back to their home countries, the researchers at Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) concluded. More than 90m people may get Zika over next few years As many as 93 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean, including 1.6 million childbearing women, are at risk of catching the Zika virus before the epidemic burns out, according to a team of researchers.

The last one year though has been the most trying. \u201cI have been hospitalised nine times over the last 11 months for chest and throat infections. I spent over Rs 3lakh in Pune and Mumbai hospitals before someone pointed out that my HIV drugs were not working. A doctor in the private sector offered to treat me for Rs 4lakh but there was no way I could afford that,\u201d said the patient. Mahesh\u2019s case is rare, but not unusual. In the battle against HIV-AIDS, some have developed resistance to most combinations of drugs used in treatment, either due to poor adherence to the regimen or mutation in the virus. For several such second-line failure patients, their only hope was the international NGO, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, but that again was an option open to a select few. Now finally, a third, more potent line of treatment has finally been rolled out across 10 hospitals in India, including JJ in Mumbai, Maulana Azad in Delhi, others in Kolkata, Chennai, etc. 18 patients from Maharashtra have been enrolled for this higher grade of antiretroviral therapy (ART), which is at least 15 times more expensive than the first-line treatment. The Byculla JJ facility, the nodal centre for HIV treatment in the state, has begun the exercise of screening 2,214 patients who are currently on second-line drugs. Doctors will look for a rapidly swelling viral load in them before concluding that the existing treatment regime is no longer effective to suppress the virus. \u201cAny patient with a viral load of above 10,000 copies/mL will immediately be started on the third-line which will be a combination of Raltegravir (400mg) , Darunavir (600mg) and Ritonavir (100mg),\u201d said Dr Vidya Nagar, nodal officer at JJ. The news that the state-run healthcare network is making available a third and more potent line of drugs has come as a huge relief. \u201cThe cost for third-line is at least 15 times more expensive than the first and five to six times more than the second line. Several patients have died only because they could not afford the treatment,\u201d said Ganesh Acharya, a member of the Mumbai AIDS Forum. Many were even taking the drugs from the private sector but could not sustain for long. Additional project director at Mumbai District Aids Control Society, Dr Shrikala Acharya, said the annual cost of the third-line regimen was around Rs 1.5lakh for each patient. Drug resistance is one of the challenges for the HIV/AIDS programme. According to studies, resistance is less than 1% in first-line and 2-3% in the second-line. \u201cWe have detected around 60-70 resistant patients across India so far against our estimation of 500. But we have drugs for more than 1,000 patients and we can procure more,\u201d said Dr BB Rewari, national programme officer, National Aids Control Organisation. Adult HIV prevalence at the national level has seen a decline from an estimated 0.38% in 2001-03 to 0.26% in 2015. Rise in new infections however has been a major point of concern. In 2015, over 86,000 new infections were detected across India. Resistance poses an additional challenge as treatment failure translates into a high viral load in patients.

Doctors will look for a rapidly swelling viral load in them before concluding that the existing treatment regime is no longer effective to suppress the virus. \"Any patient with a viral load of above 10,000 copiesmL will immediately be started on the third-line which will be a combination of Raltegravir (400mg), Darunavir (600mg) and Ritonavir (100mg),\" said Dr Vidya Nagar, nodal officer at JJ Hospital. The news that the state-run healthcare network is making available a third and more potent line of drugs has come as a huge relief. \"The cost for third-line is at least 15 times more expensive than the first and five to six times more than the second line. Several patients have died only because they could not afford the treatment,\" said Ganesh Acharya, a member of the Mumbai AIDS Forum. Many were even taking the drugs from the private sector but could not sustain for long. Additional project director at Mumbai District Aids Control Society, Dr Shrikala Acharya, said the annual cost of the third-line regimen was around Rs 1.5 lakh for each patient. Drug resistance is one of the challenges for the HIV/AIDS programme. According to studies, resistance is less than 1% in first-line and 2-3% in the second-line. \"We have detected around 60-70 resistant patients across India so far against our estimation of 500. But we have drugs for more than 1,000 patients and we can procure more,\" said Dr BB Rewari, national programme officer, National Aids Control Organisation. Adult HIV prevalence at the national level has seen a decline from an estimated 0.38% in 2001-03 to 0.26% in 2015. Rise in new infections however has been a major point of concern. In 2015, over 86,000 new infections were detected across India. Resistance poses an additional challenge as treatment failure translates into a high viral load in patients."}

The incident took place in North 24-Parganas' Hasnabad.After she tested positive for HIV on November 7, 2015, at a rural hospital in Sandeshkhali, the villagers started isolating her.

Experts at the event said that aggressive nutrition support is essential to ensure quick healing for burn care victims, attenuate the hyper-metabolic response, optimize wound healing, minimize devastating catabolism, and reduce morbidity and mortality. \"Burn injury continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Nutritional support has become an essential element of burn care. Failure to meet the increased substrate requirements may result in impaired wound healing, multi-organ dysfunction, increased susceptibility to infection, and death,\" said Ramakant Bemde, plastic surgeon and burn specialist.While speaking on 'burn patient nutrition', Pune-based dietician Archana Roy said that high protein and caloric diet is essential for speedy recovery of burn patients. Burn patients should increase their protein content in their normal diet by threefold and should continue for at least six months till they recover completely.Another dietician Renuka Raje in a similar camp held at a city-based burns and hand surgery multi-speciality hospital on Saturday said, \"The increased metabolic response associated with a severe burn surpasses that of any other disease state. A burn patient needs a high-calorie, high-protein diet to promote wound healing, minimize the risk of complications and maintain a normal nutritional level.\"\"After a burn, the body breaks down muscles to use as energy for the healing process. Protein is also lost through the burn wounds. If a burn patient does not consume enough protein to compensate, it can lead to decreased wound healing, loss of muscle mass and low immune function,\" said Pranjali Jadhav, another dietician .\"The provision of the right balance of macro and micronutrients along with additional antioxidants is essential to mitigate the hypermetabolic and hypercatabolic state that results following a burn injury,\" said Bemde."}

The numbers, though based on voluntary disclosure of clients visiting HIV testing centres, have raised serious concerns about safety and testing protocols at blood banks in the city. The RTI response by the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) shows that 18 got HIV through infected blood in 2015-16. The infections more than doubled (42) in 2014-15. In 2013-14, 25 infections were attributed to blood transfusion.The disclosure came as the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) claimed that transfusion-transmitted infections are largely restricted to rural areas with limited medical infrastructure. Government agencies fighting HIV in the city are clueless about the source of the untested blood. \u201cWe were told there is no mechanism to trace the source of the infected blood or find out which bank supplied it.It is a worrying situation,\u201c said Chetan Kothari, who filed the RTI. The numbers were collated from integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) at all major public hospitals of the city. MDACS said only a miniscule percentage of HIV cases in the city are caused by infected blood. \u201cThe heterosexual route is still responsible for more than 90% infections. Out of the 8,000odd cases detected in the city annually, only 0.02% is attributable to blood transfusion,\u201c said Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, MDACS. Activists, however, felt blood banks have a major role to play. \u201cAs per rules, when a donor turns out to be HIV positive, heshe must be informed and referred to the centres. But most blood banks don't do it,\u201c said an employee of a leading blood bank who has been advocating safe blood. He insisted the blood donor, unaware of his status, continues to donate blood. \u201cIf he is within the 3-6month window, the ELISA test used to check blood in most banks won't be able to detect the virus,\u201c he said. Therefore, a huge emphasis should be on pre-donor counselling. \u201cA detailed history of the donor before blood donation, where they are asked open questions about their lifestyles, can significantly bring down infection. But, unfortunately, at most blood camps, it is looked at as a waste of time,\u201c said Dr Zarine Bharucha, chairperson, Federation of Bombay Blood Banks (FBBB). Dearth of infrastructure and manpower at blood banks are additional challenges. A pathologist told TOI there is a staff shortage at most banks. \u201cBlood is not tested for days or there is shortage of kits. This can lead to false negativity or positivity,\u201c the doctor said."}

It is the first therapy created to track down and destroy HIV in every part of the body \u2014 including in the dormant cells that evade current treatments. If successful, it offers hope of an irreversible cure for HIV and could save millions of pounds spent on drugs. Early tests show the virus is undetectable in the man's blood. But he will have to wait some months before confirmation on whether the treatment has permanently cleared the disease. It is possible that the absence of the virus could be down to the conventional drugs that he has also been taking which can temporarily clear the body of the disease. Mark Samuels, managing director of the National Institute for Health Research Office for Clinical Research Infrastructure, which set up the medical consortium, told the newspaper: \"This is one of the first serious attempts at a full cure for HIV. We are exploring the real possibility of curing HIV. This is a huge challenge and it's still early days but the progress has been remarkable.\" The HIV virus is mostly transmitted by sex. Once in the body it targets T-cells, part of the immune system, splicing itself into their DNA. If the T-cell is active the HIV hijacks it, turning it into a tiny factory spewing millions more viruses to infect other T-cells. It is this aspect of HIV activity that is targeted and suppressed by anti-retroviral therapies (ART). What ART cannot do is pick out the millions of infected T-cells lying dormant around the body -- but waiting to spring into life should ART fail. It is the HIV reservoir in these dormant cells that the research group is targeting. \"It would be great if a cure has happened. My last blood test was a couple of weeks ago and there is no detectable virus. However, that could be the anti-retroviral therapies, so we have to wait to be sure,\" the London-based patient said. The new trial is being backed by the UK's state-funded National Health Service (NHS) because it could save millions by removing the need to treat HIV patients with ART, which costs around 380,000 pounds per person over their lifetime."}

The therapy is combining standard antiretroviral drugs with another one that reactivates dormant HIV and a vaccine that induces the immune system to destroy the infected cells. Antiretoviral drugs alone are highly effective at stopping the virus from reproducing but do not eradicate the disease, so must be taken for life. The 44-year-old Briton is the first among 50 people to complete a trial of the treatment, designed by scientists and doctors from Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College, University College London and King's College.

HIV is able to hide from the immune system in dormant cells where sophisticated testing cannot find it, and therefore resist therapy . The treatment endeavours to trick the virus into emerging from its hiding places and then trigger the body's immune system to recognise it and attack it, an approach that has been called \u201ckick and kill\u201c. The new therapy works in two stages. Firstly ,a vaccine helps the body recognise the HIV-infected cells so it can clear them out. Secondly, a new drug called Vorinostat activates the dormant Tcells so they can be spotted by the immune system."}

This puts them at greater risk of HIV. The study, undertaken by a team from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, covered 11,700 men who have sex with men (MSM) in 12 districts, including Chennai. It found that close to 23% of gender non-conforming boys were victimised by older trusted men, which pushed them to engage in HIV-risk behaviour later in life. Epidemiologist Sunil Solomon, who was part of the research, said when the team set out to study the burden of HIV among MSM, several participants they surveyed shared their sexual experiences as children. \u201cWhat troubled us was that many of them described it as experience, not realizing they were survivors of abuse. They thought it was natural, which only further marginalized them,\u201d said Solomon. A kothi (effeminate man) in Chennai recalled his uncle molesting him when he was three. \u201cI didn't know what he was doing,\u201d the study quoted him as saying. Later in life, he tested positive for HIV. \u201cI didn't tell anyone what happened to me. When they (his family) scold me (for having HIV), I want to say `You should have taken care when I was young. I am alone now'.\u201d According to official estimates, men who have sex with men have a 12-14 times higher prevalence of HIV than other men. The study found that the prevalence of child sexual abuse was higher among \"gender non-conforming men\" than the general population, which also increased their vulnerability to HIV. They found that those who had a history of abuse had approximately 2.5 times more lifetime male sexual partners compared to those without and the HIV prevalence was almost double in the former group. Child sexual abuse in general has been identified as an important predictor of high-risk sexual behaviour later in life for both men and women, including early sexual debut, unprotected sex, multiple partners, and engagement in transactional sex, which increases the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. A study by UNICEF, covering 13 states, found that more than half of children (53%) reported abuse, with the prevalence being higher for boys than girls (53% and 23% respectively). The study found the prevalence of child sexual abuse among the group to be the highest in Tamil Nadu where 43.2% of the participants claimed they were sexually abused, with Coimbatore having the highest at 70.2%. In Chennai, 34.3% said they were abused. Experts say the prevalence is probably high in the south because of better reporting. Child rights and LGBT activists say the study has highlighted the need for more intervention programmes for boys who have been victims of abuse. \u201cWhile abuse is generally high among children, the prevalence is exceptionally high among gender nonconforming boys. They are already grappling with being different from how the society describes their gender. Abuse just makes things tougher,\u201c said Dr L Ramakrishnan, country director, SAATHI, an organisation that works on HIV/AIDS."}

In such camps, organised last year during Diwali, RSACS found that the prevalence of HIV was almost double in villages with high concentration of migrants. The agency found that 0.59% of such population had HIV. All those who tested HIV positive during the screenings were advised to undergo second and third round of confirmatory tests. As per official estimates, 20,037 persons were screened for HIV at 10-day camps organised in 100 villages of 11 districts last year. The villages were identified on the basis of large number of people migrating to other states for work and returning during the festive season. District collector Pali Kumar Pal Gautam said that six places have been identified in Pali for voluntary health camps. These camps will also provide care for those suffering from other diseases.

TIMES VIEW Efforts are being ramped up across the world to increase awareness on AIDS and HIV to remove the social stigma associated with the disorder. In India too, the government and many private organisations have been working towards ensuring that those with HIV are not discriminated against, and denied the right to a complete life.However, it is clear that these efforts have not percolated deep enough in our state. Children, affected by the disease for no fault of theirs, should not be the victims of discriminatory practices and the government must root them out."}

For the first time, researchers showed that a combined approach - using a common cold virus to introduce a vaccine into the body, as well as an injection of a DNA-based vaccine - may help protect against HIV in the gut and bodily cavities. \"With sexual activity being one of the primary methods of HIV transmission, it is necessary to try to protect those parts of the body that are most likely to encounter the virus first,\" said Branka Grubor-Bauk, from the University of Adelaide in Australia. \"A possible reason why previous HIV vaccine trials have not been successful is because of this lack of a frontline protection,\" Grubor-Bauk said. The laboratory studies, conducted so far in mice represent an important step forward in attempts to introduce a first line of defence against HIV at the site of infection. \"In mice, we delivered a rhinovirus (or common cold virus) inside the nose, and this virus had been altered to include HIV proteins,\" Grubor-Bauk said. \"At the same time, the mice also received an injection into the skin containing a DNA-based vaccine. This approach resulted in very specific responses in the immune system,\" she said. \"This vaccine approach encompasses two different arms of the immune system: white blood cells that attack the HIV virus, and specific antibodies that recognise and shut down HIV-positive cells,\" she added. \"There is an element of HIV known as Tat that helps the virus to replicate quite rapidly,\" said Eric Gowans, professor at University of Adelaide. The antibodies inhibit the Tat effect, preventing HIV from replicating itself, Gowans added. \"Overall, we found that infection was considerably reduced in the mice we studied,\" he said. The study appears in the journal Scientific Reports."}

According to a study by National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), between January 2015 and May 2016, 127 patients in the state contracted HIV due to inappropriate blood transfusion. Out of 184 licensed blood banks in the state, only 66 are NACO certified for safe blood. Going by the report, Uttar Pradesh tops the list with 371 HIV positive cases triggered through blood transfusion, followed by Gujarat (292), Maharashtra (276), New Delhi (264) and West Bengal (135). Officials at Indian Foundation for Safe Blood (IFSB), an organization that works towards creating awareness about diseases transmitted during blood transfusions, said: \u201cGlobally, 15 % of HIV is transmitted through blood transfusions and in India the rate is extremely alarming. In the past five years, 9,000 people in India got affected by HIV due to blood transfusion. In Chhattisgarh blood transfusion has become a major carrier of AIDS. In Jodhpur, 53 kids were tested positive for Hepatitis C after receiving infected blood. Although better than five other states, Karnataka still doesn\u2019t look safe.\u201d Blood transfused without proper checks could result in deadly infections like HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Malaria, Syphilis, Dengue and Chikungunya. Explaining the reasons behind random collection of blood, IFSB officials added: \u201cOften, shortage of blood leads to unhealthy ways of collecting it. Another problem is non-availability of the exact blood group. Also, only a very small percentage of blood is collected through repeat voluntary blood donors, who are the safest donors. Most of the others are first-time donors who are more likely to transmit infections as they aren\u2019t tested in advance. Further, majority of blood is collected through mass blood donation camps which lack proper facilities for screening.\u201d Asked about ways to tackle the problem, another source from IFSB said, \u201cThe method of testing needs to improve. The Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) method should be used to detect HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. NAT is conducted in two ways --- Mini Pool Nucleic Acid Testing and Individual Donor Nucleic Acid Testing (ID NAT). In the first one, blood samples are pooled together for the purpose of testing. However, there\u2019s a disadvantage. Even if one sample contains a virus, the entire batch has to be discarded and each sample tested individually all over again. ID NAT is the best method as it captures the virus itself. Increase in voluntary repeat blood donation, pre-donation health history screening and hemovigilance programme are other ways to address the issue.\u201d ID NAT method ID NAT is a conventional method of testing blood. It requires the presence of antibodies to trigger a positive test result. ID NAT is used to detect the low levels of viral genetic material present in the body. However, it happens before the body begins producing antibodies in response to a virus, enabling detection of a disease early. This method significantly reduces the time between donor exposure to the virus and the appearance of antibodies. This way, it allows for earlier detection of the infection and thereby reduces the possibility of transmission via transfusion. Pvt hospitals to blame According to NACO data, of the 66 NACO-assisted blood banks in Karnataka, 40 are in the government sector and 26 are in NGOs, charitable and voluntary sector, without a single one in the private hospital sector. IFBS officials say Karnataka has already taken steps to curb transmission of infection through blood transfusion and that it\u2019s the only state government in the country to have made ID NAT mandatory in all government blood banks and hospitals. However, this crucial blood safety technique hasn\u2019t been widely adopted by private hospitals in the state. Other affected states . Uttar Pradesh - 361 \u00b7 Gujarat - 292 \u00b7 Maharashtra - 276 \u00b7 New Delhi - 264 \u00b7 West Bengal - 135 Licensed blood banks in Karnataka \u00b7 Government hospitals - 40 \u00b7 Private hospital - 92 \u00b7 Indian Red Cross Society - 5 \u00b7 Voluntary and charitable blood banks - 36 \u00b7 Standalone private blood banks -- 11 .

Since he lived in a village, 32 km from Krishnagiri, every visit to the private hospital was agony. Detection, followed by shame and ostracization was what he feared. Plagued by many doubts - Will my children get HIV? What if I get weaker and cannot work? Anand is not alone, there are many like him who want such questions answered. Coming to their rescue are a host of startups, which offer hope and promises to improve the manageability of such conditions. Online pharmacists are proving useful to such patients, who have chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, HIV, asthma, cancer as buying online has its plus points like bulk orders, discounts of 15%-20% to manage their daily dependence on drugs. But for patients with HIV, it helps them overcome social stigma, as their purchases remain a secret. \u201cThere is no human interface, which is a huge comfort factor to some people. We cater to many remote villages in India and people can order in bulk for three-five months and a discreet package arrives at their doorsteps. We also send out refill reminders two-three weeks ahead of time,\u201d Pradeep Dadha, CEO, Netmeds, which got $50 million in funding from a group of investors, including US-based investment firm OrbiMed and MAPE Advisory. . Apart from pharmacists, telemedicine startups like Rxpress, Karma, Olito, Quadia Technoligies are also helping people with HIV access affordable healthcare from remote, rural locations. \u201cOstracisation is a huge fear and with the increase of telemedicine platforms, people are able to better access doctors,\u201d said Jagdeep Gambhir, founder of Rajasthan-based Karma Healthcare, which got undisclosed funding from Austria-based Ennovent Impact Investment Holding. \u201cWe ensure privacy and boost self-confidence. Apart from medical problems, people also want a morale boost - Will I able to work? Will I grow weaker? What if I had an open wound and used a towel?\u201d said Madhur Gopal, CEO, Rxpress, which has 12,000 registered customers. In rural areas, since patients travel long distances for doctor\u2019s consultations, sometimes there is a gap of 6-7 months before the next visit. \u201cPatients need to be educated on the need for strict medical adherence and the side-effects of anti-retrovirals. Since there is a lot of conflicting information about HIV/AIDS online, patients find it useful that they can come to us,\u201d said Gopal. Many patients confuse HIV with communicable diseases like jaundice and chicken pox. So the around-the-clock availability of doctors is another need.

The family had to travel more than 100 km from their home in northeast for medication and it was a double whammy when they realized the boy had contracted HIV virus though one such blood transfusion. However, their recent visit to a Bengaluru hospital turned things for the better. Sachin, now aged 10, is cured of thalassemia after he underwent the bone marrow transplant (BMT) five months ago and his six-year-old brother was the donor. Bone marrow transplant on a patient infected with HIV is ridden with risks and the procedure was a huge challenge for the 100-odd team of doctors and para-medical staff at the Majumdar Shaw Cancer Centre. This is, according to the doctor who treated Sachin, is the second successful case in the world and the first in India. The boy hasn\u2019t shown symptoms of HIV for the past five months. \u201cWe were devastated to know he was contracted with the deadly virus. We approached many transplant centres, but none of them wanted to even touch him,\u201d said Sachin\u2019s father who finally decided to try his luck in Bengaluru. \u201cWhen he came, the boy\u2019s immune system was weak and infections were high. I realized that HIV infection could flare up during the transplant. That was the biggest challenge for us. The whole process, including preparing the boy for the surgery, took several weeks. The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matched with his sibling, making the transplant possible,\u201d Dr Sunil Bhat, senior consultant and head of paediatric haematology, oncology and bone marrow transplant at Mazumdar Shaw Cancer Centre, Narayana Health City. Sachin\u2019s HIV infection is now under control and he no longer needs any blood transfusion, he added. It may be too early to predict, given that the transplant took place just five months ago. But if the boy doesn\u2019t show further symptoms of HIV relapse in the next one year, this procedure can be considered as a possible cure for HIV. There\u2019s no need to worry about HIV transmission between the bone marrow donor and the recipient; the donor is at no risk of contracting HIV in the process.

The situation is no better in Karnataka, with only 21% of the HIV positive transgenders and 33% of the infected female sex workers undergoing anti-retroviral therapy, according to the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS). Ahead of World AIDS Day on December 1 (Thursday), TOI found that of the 6,756 HIV-infected female sex workers in the state, only 2,257 are benefitting from anti-retroviral therapy. Similarly, of the 175 transgenders with HIV, only 37 are being treated. This despite the HIV Bill introduced in 2014 \u2014 it was amended this year \u2014 which makes anti-retroviral therapy (it can enhance longevity) a legal right for all HIV patients. \u201cA recent study conducted by Swasti for the United Nations Development Programme revealed that often doctors refuse to treat individuals from the transgender community. They are either ignored or are shown the door by doctors, who say they don\u2019t know how to treat them,\u201d said Shama Karkal, director, Avahan \u2013 Swasti, a health resource centre that works with the transgender community, sex workers and gay men. The study covered transgenders in five states \u2014 Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, UP, Gujarat and Maharashtra. The study showed that even transgenders are hesitant about getting themselves tested for HIV, though hospitals provide the facility. \u201cThere is an assumption that only those who are sexually active or sexually promiscuous need to get the test done. Transgenders are judged not only by hospital staff but also their peers,\u201d she added. Highlighting the distress of female sex workers, thoracic surgeon and director of SDS Tuberculosis Research Centre and Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, Dr Shashidhar Buggi, said: \u201cWe cannot expect others to stop discriminating against sex workers if the doctor community itself is biased. The harsh reality is despite being aware of the nature of HIV virus, the medical fraternity often chooses not to treat an infected patient. The stigma is even more deep-rooted when the patient happens to be a sex worker.\u201d Stating that numbers don\u2019t depict the real picture, Dr Buggi explained: \u201cThe existence of prevention societies is not enough to bring about a positive change in the health condition of sex workers, as the ground reality is different from what\u2019s there on paper. There is no proper retrieving system in place, with no one to assess the work of these organizations and question their accountability. Most of the cases these organizations record are under-reported.\u201d Demonetization a hindrance The recent demonetization policy has only added to the plight of transgenders as far as treatment is concerned. \u201cIt has become very difficult to meet medical and travel expenses. I recently had to undergo a uterus operation, which was an expensive procedure. The tests and follow-up visits have drilled a hole in my pocket and scrapping of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has only made it worse,\u201d said Usha, an HIV positive transgender. Manta, another transgender who\u2019s a sex worker, said: \u201cI am HIV positive but I have learnt to take care of my health. However, after demonetization, my income has drastically reduced. Either the clients don\u2019t pay or they hand over high denomination notes. Either way, I am left with no money.\u201d Social hierarchy a barrier Another study on transgenders revealed that social hierarchical systems play a major role in deciding which healthcare services an individual can access. Every decision vests with the guru. The study found that 12.3% of the community members opted for informal surgeries conducted by someone from the community or the guru as opposed to formal services provided in hospitals.

The Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART), given free at ART centres of the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), is a big succour for persons living HIV, but counsellors and doctors say that counselling them is tough. The level of depression among adolescents and youth is so acute that some have lost their spirit of optimism. An official said HIV-positive youth and teenagers are more likely to lead a depressed life if they have no family support. Sadly, in the case of most of the youth, family ties are missing with one or both parents long dead. The majority are brought up in orphanages. A few are looked after by their extended families. Akash Naik, 23, who was raised in an orphanage since birth \u2014 his parents had left him in the hospital after his HIV status came to light \u2014 has grown so pessimistic that he refuses to believe that anything positive will happen in his life. The ART staff try to boost his morale by telling him about the research under way to invent new drugs to improve quality of life of persons living with HIV, but Akash\u2019s hopes are long lost. \u201cAkash doesn\u2019t even want to consider a possibility that better drugs that can cure HIV will be invented. He is certain that HIV will not leave him till his death,\u201d a counsellor said. Of the 7,000-odd persons registered with the ART Centre of the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, maximum numbers are of those in the reproductive age group, a source said and added that most of them are depressed. Agnelo Lobo, 19, a class XII student, has failed to keep pace with studies. He went into depression after he started developing severe side effects of ART. \u201cDue to the illness he has not been able to concentrate. His mother\u2019s second marriage has further upset him. We have advised him to complete his education through correspondence courses,\u201d the official said pointing out that having to lead life without family support increases the probability of depression. \u201cOnce they turn 18, they have nowhere to go. ART lengthens lives and improves quality of life. But, now, the bigger question before them is how to lead a normal life, and that, too, all alone,\u201d he said and added that there has to be some backup plan to enable HIV-positive persons in the reproductive age group to lead a healthy life. For the last few months, Shivanand Azrekar, 25, has been going through bouts of depression. Azrekar is married and has one child and every time he visits the ART centre, the first question he asks the staff is, \u201chow much time do I have?\u201d Despite being put on ART, Azrekar\u2019s condition is deteriorating, the official said. On a positive note, Goa has succeeded in bringing mother-to-child transmission to zero. Also, the ART centre has some help coming its way in treating depressed HIV-positive youth and teenagers. Yuva clinic, a counselling centre, was opened at GMC in October to offer counselling to patients in the age group of 10-19.

A class XI student, Rihan is HIV positive, an infection he got from his parents who are now long dead. His is a two-pronged struggle. On the one hand, while he fights the infection in his body, on the other he has to battle social ostracism. Gauns is one among the 253 children and adolescents living with HIV in Goa, for whom life is a daily struggle. As they cope up with their life-threatening ailment, they battle virtually everyday with society, which looks on them with suspicion. President of Human Touch, Peter Borges informed that one or both parents of most of these children are dead. Some live with their extended family or with a single parent while some are being raised in orphanage. The HIV status, whether that of a child or an adult, is not revealed, but sometimes it does come out exposing them to discrimination, Borges said. \u201cWe managed to stop bullying in Rihan\u2019s case after we approached the school management, but it was a difficult situation nonetheless,\u201d said Peter who added that society should be more accepting of such children, and disease itself. Some of the 253 children living with HIV are in their teens. There are a few who are above 18 years of age, too. Though the government provides a monthly allowance of Rs 2,000 to persons living with HIV, Borges said not all are able to avail of the allowance due to bureaucratic hassles. There are five youngsters under his guidance for whom he has arranged a room to stay as they have no family members to rely on. To provide care and support, Goa State NGO forum on HIV/AIDs, comprising of eight NGOs, has analysed the main obstacles facing HIV+ children and charted an action agenda to overcome the same. The biggest challenge before those who are above 18 years of age is what to do next. Some though are completing their education.

The move assumes significance as the lack of HIV diagnosis is a major obstacle to reducing the burden of the infection worldwide because it hinders the government and public health agency to offer anti-retroviral therapy or other treatment options to those suffering from the disease. Estimates show around 87% of HIV-infected people in India are not even aware that they are suffering from the disease and may be unknowingly spreading the virus. Globally, around 40% of all people with HIV or over 14 million remain unaware of their status. Self-testing will be particularly relevant for those people who may find it difficult to access testing in clinical settings and might prefer self-testing as their method of choice. HIV self-test can be done by individuals by using oral fluid or blood-finger-pricks to discover their status in a private and convenient setting. Results of the test can be seen within 20 minutes or less. Those with positive results are advised to seek confirmatory tests at health clinics.

Worse, lack of a vigilant national policy on ART (anti-retroviral treatment) prescription is enhancing the risk of emergence of poly drug-resistant AIDS. On World Aids Day (December 1), medical experts point to the challenges associated with AIDS prevention and treatment. The theme of this year World Aids Day is \u2018Hands up for HIV prevention - leadership, commitment, impact\u2019. Renowned HIV/AIDS expert and Padmasri physician Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao said, \u201cIn India, as there\u2019s no strictly implemented vigilant national policy on ART (anti-retroviral treatment) prescription, a variety of doses are being administered by different physicians. And adding to the crisis, some quacks have gone to the extent of prescribing ART drugs as per their whims and fancies. Some patients having read a brand name of ART in newspapers go for self-medication; some other patients imitate prescriptions of other HIV-affected persons and go to the point of purchasing over-the-counter drugs. This problem has been accentuated due to poor vigilance by the government on drug sales. This sort of practice in the country has already been growing and may soon assume enormous proportions and lead to the emergence of poly drug-resistant AIDS. If corrective measures are not initiated soon, this problem may threaten the efficacy ART therapy.\u201d However, it has been proved that with ART drugs, the average life expectancy of AIDS patients has increased. Therefore, ART is a very important mode of treatment. \u201cAs a result of advanced researches in AIDS treatment, now, the patients can be given a substantial life while death can be postponed dramatically. The average life expectancy of AIDS patients on a quality treatment is around 71.5 years. It is also proved that starting Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) late would end up to 15 years reduced life expectancy. Therefore, it\u2019s recommended by WHO to start ART irrespective of CD4 count once a person is confirmed HIV positive. Recently, the efficacy of ART on reducing the risk of sexual transmission of HIV has been estimated to be more than 95 per cent. This component is going to play a vital role among discordant couples who are interested in having a child without HIV transmission. To prevent mother to child transmission, appropriately administering ART is universally accepted,\u201d added Dr Rao. The two Telugu-speaking states too report one of the highest instances of HIV/AIDS in India. According to the latest statistics, there are 1.85 lakh HIV positive cases in Andhra Pradesh and Telengana. In India, this is the highest incidence of HIV after Maharashtra, which has around 1.45 lakh cases. Another problem is that, even after three decades of its existence, treatment of HIV is still elusive for many positive patients in India and elsewhere. \u201cThough treatment of AIDS is extremely cost-effective when compared to cost of management of several other diseases such as heart, kidney, and liver, this is not yet well understood by the people in India. The best treatment for HIV/AIDS including the latest tests of diagnosis HIV genome, monitoring of CD4 counts, viral load, kidney functioning, liver functioning would cost around Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 only. Even this cost is a heavy burden for many patients due to which they avoid coming for treatment, aver doctors. Meanwhile, according to the medical and health department, in Vizag district, there has been a slight decrease in instances of HIV from last year (from 2.5 per cent to 2.2 per cent). \u201cCurrently, 29,455 people have been identified as HIV infected in the district, among which 12,551 are on ART drugs. Besides, 4,731 patients are being provided Rs 1,000 as monthly pension,\u201d said District Medical and Health officer (DMHO) Dr J Sarojini."}

NAAT, which was approved for use in 2002 by the FDA, can detect HIV infections in blood donors earlier than other screening tests because it detects viral genes rather than antibodies or antigens. The appearance of antibodies, which happens after an infected donor's immune system responds to the virus, requires time. Similarly, detection of antigens also requires time as it needs a higher level of virus to appear in the bloodstream. In both cases, a 'window period' is created during which a donor can be infected but test negative for HIV. On Tuesday, a source told TOI that the state government was ready to start NAAT in government hospitals but would need the Centre's help to install the sophisticated testing device. TOI has learned that in 2015 a proposal had been sent to the state government to make NAAT available in government hospitals and blood banks but not much headway has been made. \"Besides the cost, NAAT requires expert handling. Assam lacks the resources to operate the device,\" said an expert. The NAAT machine costs around Rs 2 to 3 crore."}

People infected with the disease suppress it for fear of ostracism instead of seeking medical assistance. Awareness about the ailment convincing patients to go to health centres has sadly gone down. The Assam State AIDS Control Society (ASACS) on Wednesday acknowledged that the level of awareness about HIV/AIDS has plummeted in Assam in the last few years. Manvendra Pratap Singh, incumbent project director, said one of the reasons for the drop in awareness could be the perceived notion that HIV/AIDS is not as scary as before because of the availability of drugs and antiretroviral therapy (ART). \"The risk groups should be the focus areas of campaign. The fear psychosis attached to HIV/AIDS is dwindling in comparison to the Nineties. We don't see much awareness programmes on TV these days. There is a need to mobilise resources and increase awareness. In rural Assam, people don't want to disclose their HIV status,\" said Singh. The first case of AIDS in Assam was reported over two decades ago. But even today, comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS, especially among women in the age group of 15 and 49, is abysmal, according to a study by the National Family Health Survey (2015-16) released this year. The study revealed only 9.4% women in that age group had comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS. The term 'comprehensive knowledge' means a woman adopting measures to check the chance of getting infected with HIV/AIDS through consistent use of contraceptives and having one uninfected, faithful sexual partner. The 9.4% figure cuts a sorry picture vis-a-vis states and UTs like Andhra Pradesh (29%), Goa (34.6%), Andaman and Nicobar Islands (28.2%), Manipur (40.7%), Sikkim (25.5%) and Tripura (28%). Bihar and Meghalaya have also scored miserably on the comprehensive knowledge count with figures of 10.1% and 13.3%, respectively. Till September 2015, 38% HIV positive cases were detected from Kamrup (Metro) followed by Cachar, Dibrugarh and Nagaon districts. From Kamrup (Metro) district alone, 4,268 HIV positive cases were detected till September 30, 2015. The rate of increase in annual new HIV infections is the highest in Assam and Tripura."}

Doctors however say that with proper awareness and guidance from the treating physicians AIDS has become a more manageable syndrome. Though no specific data is available in the country on HIV positive persons dying due to tuberculosis, TB is said to be one of the biggest killer of AIDS patients. Dr Ashutosh Somalwar, associate professor of medicine at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), told TOI that HIV and tuberculosis was a deadly synergy and HIV infection has led to resurgence of TB in India. \u201cAbout 40% of HIV patients suffer from TB as a co-infection with TB in India. HIV infection reduces general immunity of any person to a great extent and hence opportunistic infections like TB bacteria catch them easily. These patients are thus said to be immunocompromised,\u201d he said. Dr Somalwar said that the HIV infected patients can suffer from pulmonary (lung), extra pulmonary (organs other than lungs), atypical forms of TB and multi-drug resistance TB. Patients with higher immunosuppression (whose CD4 count is less than 200) atypical forms of TB like thoracic lymphadenopathy and lower lobe lung involvement are seen more often. \u201cHIV-TB co-infection can lead to increased death rate and hence all patients of HIV should be screened for TB and vice versa,\u201d said Dr Somalwar. However, the treatment of TB in HIV patients is similar to the non-HIV cases. But in these patients, the treatment needs to be started at the earliest. After a few weeks of anti-TB drugs, patient is put on anti-retro-viral therapy or ART is started after patient stabilizes with these medicines. All HIV infected persons with TB must be put on ART irrespective of CD4 count. ART drug treatment needs some modification in patients who are receiving anti-TB treatment. Dr Somalwar said that the multi-drug resistance TB in which the patient does not respond to the drug regime commonly given to patients poses other kinds of problems in HIV patients. All patients with HIV-TB co-infection should be tested for anti-TB drug resistance. If resistance is found, patient may require second line of anti-TB treatment and this situation can lead to higher death rates. \u2018Treat AIDS patients without any bias\u2019 HIV infection may not be as dreaded as it was about three decades back, yet AIDS patients need to be dealt with much differently than any other disease. These persons need to be treated without being judgemental or biased. Also, unless the treating doctor, be it from a government set-up or a private practitioner, maintains confidentiality about the patient as they are still not comfortable with being labelled as a HIV positive or AIDS patient. Speaking to reporters on the eve of the World AIDS Day on Wednesday, Dr Nitin Shinde, consultant, infectious diseases at Wockhardt Hospital, said that the treating doctors must have a very positive and neutral approach, both for treatment of the syndrome as well as the patient as an individual. \u201cWhile South Africa begins clinical trials on HIV vaccine and AIDS becomes more closer to being a treatable syndrome, HIV infections remain grossly unreported in India. This is because mostly only the patients from government hospitals are part of the statistics,\u201d said Dr Shinde. Dr Shinde said one of the good things that has happened with AIDS is that its treatment has become much cheaper. \u201cThe treatment at one time used to cost as much as Rs25-30,000 a month. Now in private set-up it costs Rs2,000 a month,\u201d he said."}

The move assumes significance as the lack of HIV diagnosis is a major obstacle to reducing the burden of the infection worldwide because it hinders the government and public health agency to offer anti-retroviral therapy or other treatment options to those suffering from the disease. Estimates show around 87% of HIV-infected people in India are not even aware that they are suffering from the disease and may be unknowingly spreading the virus. Globally , around 40% of all people with HIV or over 14 million remain unaware of their status. Self-testing will be particularly relevant for those people who may find it difficult to access testing in clinical settings and might prefer self-testing as their method of choice. HIV self-test can be done by individuals by using oral fluid or blood-finger-pricks to discover their status in a private and convenient setting. Results of the test can be seen within 20 minutes or less.Those with positive results are advised to seek confirmatory tests at health clinics. WHO recommends they receive information and links to counselling as well as rapid referral to prevention, treatment and care services. A senior official said, India may initially adopt the UN agency's suggestions for self-testing among high risk communities where the incidence and chances of spread is higher. \u201cMillions of people with HIV are still missing out on life-saving treatment, which can also prevent HIV transmission to others,\u201c said Dr Margaret Chan, director-general, WHO. \u201cHIV selftesting should open the door for many more people to know their HIV status and find out how to get treatment and access prevention services.\u201c Estimates by National Aids Control Organization, which works under the ministry of health and family welfare, show over 2.2 crore people were tested during 2013-14, of which 2,40,234 people were found HIV positive. In 2015, the total number of people living with HIV in India were estimated at 21.17 lakh, whereas 86,000 new cases were found.Though incidence of HIV in India has declined substantially since 2000 by around 66%, lack of accessibility to testing and the stigma attached to HIV poses a challenge for uptake of HIV diagnosis."}

Every year, more than 3,386 HIV-positive pregnant women in the state need anti-retroviral treatment to prevent their infants from acquiring the virus. In 2015, around 3,600 pregnant women were given the treatment. \u201cMother-to-child transmission is the most common way for children to get HIV infection. Notably, children under 15 years of age accounted for 6.54% of the total HIV infected population in India. In most of these cases, the disease was transmitted through parents during birth,\u201c said infectious disease expert Milind Kulkarni. Today, it is possible to prevent perinatal HIV with effective and sustained use of medica tion. \u201cMost pe ople in India are unaware of this fact but an HIV posi tive mother can give birth to a disease-free child. A number of countries inclu ding Thailand have succeeded in completely eliminating this mode of transmission of HIVAIDS,\u201c said Kulkarni.

Since HIV is transmitted through blood and blood-related products, transmission from an infected mother to her child can occur at any time during pregnancy. \u201cPutting infected expectant mothers on antiretroviral therapy as soon as pregnancy is confirmed is an essential intervention. At birth, the baby is also given a six-week therapy to combat the threat.This protocol can successfully prevent mother-tochild transmission in most cases. Since breastfeeding can also transmit the HIV virus, infants born to infected mothers are recommended formula milk as a safe alternative to breast milk,\u201c he explained.

Yakshagana shows will be held at 20 places in Mangaluru, Puttur, Belthangady, Bantwal and Sullia taluks till December 10. Meanwhile, Red Ribbon Clubs have been formed in 32 degree colleges and 32 PU colleges in the district to spread awareness against the disease among young generation. Such clubs will function in association with the NSS units of their respective colleges throughout the year. Awareness programmes will also be held in selected 100 high schools in the district, he added. HIV positive cases in Dakshina Kannada district are on the decline as per statistics, Dr Rao said, adding that increased awareness is the main reason for decline in the number of HIV positive cases in the district. Dakshina Kannada zilla panchayat president Meenakshi Shanthigodu inaugurated the World Aids Day programme. University College principal Uday Kumar presided."}

This year\u2019s theme \u2018Hands up for HIV prevention\u2019 focussed on prevention of spreading HIV infections, discrimination and AIDS related deaths. \u201cThe total number of people living with HIV in India was estimated to be around 2.1 million in 2015. Notably, children under 15 years of age accounted for 6.54 per cent of the total HIV infected population in India, a bulk of them having been transmitted the disease from their parents at birth. Eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV-AIDS is the next major challenge for India, the risk of which can be successfully minimised or even eliminated with effective and sustained use of medication,\u201d said Dr P Haranath, dermatologist from Bhavya Skin Care Centre, Vizag. As per NACO Technical Estimate Report (2015), out of an estimated 29 million annual pregnancies in India, about 35,255 occur in HIV positive pregnant women. This data postulates that in the absence of any intervention, over 10,000 babies infected with HIV are being born every year. According to World Health Organization, without any intervention, transmission rates range from 15 per cent to 45 per cent. \u201cPutting infected expectant mothers on anti-retroviral therapy as soon as pregnancy is discovered is an essential intervention. At birth, the baby is also put on a brief six-week therapy to combat the threat. This protocol can successfully prevent mother-to-child transmission in most cases,\u201d he said. Relentless awareness campaigns and successful use of anti-retroviral therapy has helped India reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS prevalence steadily over the past two decades. India\u2019s new infections were estimated to be at 86,000 in 2015, showing a marked decline by 66% as compared to the year 2000. Visakhapatnam District AIDS Control Society organised an awareness programme on World AIDs Day at the AU Assembly Hall on Thursday. Addressing the gathering on the occasion, vice-chancellor Prof G Nageswara Rao underlined the importance of the awareness and knowledge on the health problems of unprotected sex and the diseases like AIDS. He said students, in particular, should play a vital role on eliminating such social evils from the society for a better and health society by bringing awareness among the masses about the ill effects of the diseases and causes of the disease. Meanwhile, the Medical Department of Waltair Division of East Coast Railway also observed World AIDS Day on Thursday by organizing awareness programmes and taking out a rally to propagate the fall out of the dreaded disease. In the Agency areas, NGO Nature along with Araku Area Hospital and hostels took out a rally and formed a human chain at Araku. World AIDS Day was also observed by Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao Hospitals, Child Foundation of India, OPDSS and Ascent College opposite GVMC Gandhi Statue. Hundreds of college students participated in the event by applying different colours to palms and arms depicting powerful messages such as \u201cKnow AIDS: No AIDS, Safe Sex Prevents AIDS, ART Adherence: 75 Years of Life. Students also performed flash mobs on HIV awareness at different places in the city based on the theme. Chief guest of the event, HIV/AIDS expert Padmashri Dr Kutikupala Surya Rao, said as a result of advanced researches in AIDS treatment, now the patients can be given a substantial life and death can be postponed."}

Fifty pregnant women were tested HIV positive in the government-run integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) from April to October this year. Around 1,076 positive cases were found during this period. The number, which JSACS officials believe is only 'the tip of the iceberg', adds to the ever rising HIV cases. As per a National Aids Control Organization (NACO) estimate of 2015, the HIV infections among pregnant women recorded a near three-fold jump from 2010. Around 320 children, including 227 newborns, contracted HIV in their mother's wombs or at later stages. In 2012-13, 235 children, 150 infants, were reported to be HIV positive. Despite Jharkhand being ranked low in HIV cases among children in comparison to Bihar and Odisha, JSACS has reasons to be worried now with the latest data surpassing the records of infected 56 mother-baby pairs of 2013-2014 (56were found to be HIV) and 2012-2013 (36 were found). Though no state level survey on HIV infected children (below 15 years) is available), JSACS estimate say that the number could be anywhere around 3,000. Explaining the steady growth in number, JSACS said most of the women, JSACS said, come from the industrial areas and districts where migration for employment is high. \"However, the numbers can be higher because many of the men who contract the disease outside Jharkhand refuse to get themselves screened. These men in turn transmit the disease to the women,\" a JSACS official said. Approximately 25,000 people are living with HIV in Jharkhand. Dr BB Poddar, additional project director JSACS said the \"timely interventions and awareness campaigns are underway across the state and mining areas and amid truckers\"."}

About 500 children, both girls and boys of different age groups are given treatment at the ART centre, deputy programme director (HIV/AIDS) at BHU ART centre, Dr Jaya Chakravarty said. The programme was organised to encourage the children to fight against the disease. Over 15,000 adults (both men and women) are registered with this centre, out of whom 6,000 make regular visit to take medicines. She said that BHU ART centre is one of the 10 centres of excellence in HIV care in the country and lone in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Besides being the tertiary centre to provide second and third line drugs, the BHU ART is also a research and training centre. The ART centre was started in March 2005 in BHU and it was upgraded to a centre of excellence (COE) in August, 2009. According to the doctor, if by mistake one acquires this disease, he/she should not lose courage and should get investigated and proper medication. The early diagnosis helps in preventing and significantly delaying morbid conditions associated with HIV/AIDS. If the HIV-infected person is irregular in time or quantity of the drugs, the treatment becomes ineffective. The HIV people can live a productive and healthy life if they take care of health, eating habits and lifestyle. In last one year, over 100 new HIV patients were identified in several high risk areas of the city, said the president of Banaras Network for Positive People Living with HIV-AIDS."}

The Society for People\u2019s Action for Development (SPAD), an NGO working for the betterment of sex workers and educating them on avoiding AIDS, distributes 16,000 condoms per month. During the festive season, the number increases to 18,000 per month.

This, despite doctors working hard to eliminate HIV transmission from mother to child. Approximately, a third of these women are pregnant. According to the latest statistics, over 3,000 women in Gurugram did not undergo HIV tests till October 2016. Of this, 1,215 pregnant women had been counselled to do so. Till October, 14 cases of pregnant women having HIV have been confirmed. According to doctors, it is possible to eliminate transmission, but only if mothers agree to get tested. Dr Himanshu Batra, head of the department of paediatrics at Columbia Asia hospital said, HIV testing is a part of routine screening at all private hospitals. \u201cAll of my patients get tested for HIV, no matter what,\u201d he said. It is not the case everywhere, though. In 2015, 7,700 men were counselled at government-run integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC), and 6,660 men opted to get tested for HIV. The number is higher in the case of women, where 21,562 women underwent counselling last year, but only 18,449 opted for testing. The gap is 3,113 women. In 2014, this number was 1,600, in 2013, it was 1,005 and in 2012 it was 899. According to Vijay Kumar, the nodal district officer of the AIDS programme run by the Haryana State AIDS Control Society, there are many reasons behind the figures. \u201cSome of them don\u2019t get tested because they don\u2019t want to wait for the long hours of testing (it takes around two hours for an HIV test). Others think they are not at much risk, and therefore drop out of the tests. We cannot force them as it is done only with their consent,\u201d he said. HIV infection can be caused through various means: sexual transmission, blood transfusion, intravenous drug use and from mother to child. However, 90% of children with HIV contract it from their parents. According to doctors, a complete cure is possible if detection is early. According to National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), its \u2018Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission\u2019 services cover only about 47% annual estimated pregnancies in India. In 2015-16, 12.7 million pregnant women accessed this service. A NACO report says the number of women who are counselled anyway covers only 47% of women, making the number of women who do not get tested significantly large. \u201cIn such a situation, complete elimination of HIV transmission from mother-to-child appears to be a distant possibility,\u201d it reads."}

This was after IMA, analysed blood samples of 49,000 persons and found that Elisa test failed to detect several infections, thus increasing the risk of transmitting bloodborne diseases from donor to recipient. IMA conducted Elisa test as well as NAT on all 49,000 persons who donated blood to IMA 's blood bank over the past three years. The results showed that eight cases of hepatitis B, one HIV and one case of hepatitis C were not detected by Elisa test. However, it was detected using NAT. \u201cBlood transfusion is a lifesaving procedure. But, there is always minimal risk of transmitting blood-borne infections like HIV , hepatitis B and C from the donor to the recipient. The conventional Elisa test employed in blood banks fail to detect infections in the window period,\u201c said IMA president Dr M Narayanan. At present, only IMA 's blood bank has NAT facility in the city . While donors in the city welcomed the move, they were concerned about two things: cost and whether it is a ploy by private companies to sell their NAT kit. \u201cStudies have shown that NAT is better than Elisa.Government hospitals have to introduce NAT to popularise it,\u201c said Jishnu Raj, coordinator, Blood Donors, Kerala.While Elisa test costs around Rs 400, NAT costs Rs 800. Both Elisa and NAT are used to determine if a person has antibodies related to certain infectious conditions. However, there is the issue of window period. Window period is the length of time after infection during which a test has a higher chance of incorrectly reporting the absence of disease (false negative). The window period for antibody tests can range from 3 weeks to 6 months. \u201cNucleic acid tests typically have shorter window periods, and this means that they can be used more reliably , particularly in cases where the exact point of infection isn't entirely clear,\u201c said Dr Narayanan. NAT was first introduced between 1999 and 2001 in blood banks across France, Germany , Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Studies showed that countries that introduced NAT have en countered a decrease in residual risk of viral transmissions. Although, other safety measures such as more stringent selection of blood donors have contributed as well; a marked decrease is evident. The residual risk for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission prior to NAT was 0.64 cases per million in France and 3.94 per million in Spain which decreased to 0.1 per million and 2.33 per million respectively after NAT was adopted.HIV NAT yield rates were estimated at 0.3 per million donations in France and Spain as opposed to 0.59 and 2.48 respectively preceding NAT. IMA's move is crucial as India has the second-highest pool of HIV persons estimated at 5.7 million and 3-5% HBV and 1-2% HCV cases reported among a population of almost 1.2 billion. Post-transfusion prevalence of hepatitis has been observed at 1-1.8% for hepatitis B and 0.28-0.5% for hepatitis C and 0.23-0.47 for HIV. \u201cTo ensure that blood banks and hospitals shift to NAT, we will soon be conducting a training session for doctors,\u201c added Dr Narayanan."}

The treatment of AIDS, however, has got a major boost with scientists from Bengaluru reporting in a study that if the mutation rate of HIV virus is increased by two to six times, it could become ineffective against its host/human body in 10 years. Lead researcher Narendra Dixit, however, cautions that by increasing the mutation rate, such a person will not get cured, but their findings reveal how long it will take for the virus to become non-infectious, and the disease non-progressive. Some of these drugs to increase the mutation levels are already undergoing clinical trials. According to the researchers, a major advantage of these drugs is that they are not susceptible to drug resistance. Hence, Dixit, who is an associate professor at Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, said that in the coming years, with better drug combinations, the treatment window could be reduced further. Their findings have been reported in \u201cPhysical Biology\u201d journal. Scientists have so far failed in their efforts to find a permanent cure as HIV virus mutates or changes rapidly, thus making drugs and potential vaccines ineffective. This implies that by the time a drug tries to make the virus ineffective, another mutant that is resistant to the drug, has already developed. Hence, this latest finding is important because it establishes that a threshold level exists for HIV and the virus loses its potency level if its mutation rate is increased by over six times its current or natural mutation rate. \u201cOne reason why researchers have not been successful in their endeavour to find a permanent cure for HIV/AIDS is because of the high rate at which the virus mutates, causing it to overcome the selection pressures imposed by drugs and potential vaccines. From the virus\u2019s point of view, however, there is a flipside to having very high mutation rates. If it increases beyond a tipping point, called error threshold, then it leads to low fitness in the virus population, making it an ineffective pathogen,\u201d said Dixit. Prof Dixit and his team have been studying the process of infection caused by HIV and its evolution using certain computer simulation models in the laboratory, which allow them to closely track the fitness levels of the genetically diverse populations within a host and the factors that contribute to it. The finding also has implications for how we treat AIDS, said the research team. High mutation rates can be induced in HIV using a special class of anti-retroviral drugs. If the mutation rate can be raised to the error threshold, then, in principle, the virus can be prevented from causing progressive infection. This research shows that, in fact, such a benign state can be achieved by using mutation-inducing drugs for a period of about 10 years. For their study, the research team used information from the drugs which are currently under trial. They demonstrated in their simulation model that by administering these drugs for 10 years, the replicating HIV will become harmless. This, according to experts, can be an alternative method or strategy to attacking and eventually killing the virus."}

How these funds were swindled remains a mystery , but insiders claimed that corrupt officials might have created benami NGO beneficiaries. \u201cThe NGOs (called Target Intervention Groups) totalling about 178 in the twin states, including, 58 working with TSACS for HIVAIDS prevention activities, were the worst hit as officials did not pay us for these two years but claimed in their official records that our services were paid for,\u201c alleged B Jayamma, founder of city-based Chaithanya Mahila Mandali (CMM), an award winning community-based organisation working with female sex workers. Out of Rs 70 crore that remains untracked, but shown as Rs spent', Rs 40 crore belongs to these NGOs but they were never paid their dues. In a letter to the TSACS project director last month, Jayamma sought severance of her NGO's partnership with TSACS citing Rs fund crisis'. \u201cThe TSACS still owe us 21 lakh for the services we rendered to thousands of female sex workers in the city and their rehabilitation in these two years. Now, we have no money to pay to our activists,\u201c she added. Sources said 830 contract officials working in various districts in over half a dozen divisions like ART centres, basic services, district aids prevention control units (Dapcus), Integrated Counselling & Testing Centres among others have not been paid their arrears and hikes for the last two years. \u201cNACO had released funds to enable TSACS to give them hike, but it was never given to them,\u201c said an office bearer of Telangana State Aids Control Employees' Joint Action Committee, which submitted a memorandum to the government two months ago seeking clearance of their arrears. \u201cThe employees are facing a lot of problems in meeting day to day expenses as we are getting meagre salaries,\u201c the JAC said in its letter appealing for the early release of their arrears."}

The machine has been malfunctioning since November 2016 and though it was repaired last week it stopped functioning three days later. HIV patients who are likely in need of ART are administered a CD4 test to count their viral load. Currently, persons living with HIV are given ART on the basis of clinical analysis without checking viral load. CD4 cells play a major role in protecting the body from infection.

The RTI reply also revealed that grants received by official for AIDS Control Programme in various districts in these two years were also not fully utilized. The Nagpur district received grants of Rs17.11 lakh of which only Rs12.88 lakh was spent while another Rs91,500 was utilized on the awareness campaigns.

When asked about nonfunctioning mobile ICTC vans in the state, she said, \u201cThere is budget issue but these mobile ICTC vans will soon hit streets.\u201c \u201cThe filmsy ground under which I was removed was said to be several complaints received by the National AIDS Control Organisation during my contractual service under TSACS besides so called misconducts I allegedly committed. I have been targeted despite the fact that its management is entrusted to an NGO,\u201c said M Ramulu. This prompted him to turn into an Right to Information Act (RTI) activist seeking details of all the 10 mobile ICTC vans running in the state and expenses thereof incurred by the government in the month of December, 2015. What's ironic is that none of the 10 mobile ICTC vans -which are supposed to visit high risk areas for conducting HIV tests on vulnerable groups -sanctioned in each district in Telangana is working as the operations and management of these vans were shifted to specific NGOs but they backed out due to fund shortage. Even the stationary ICTC units in the state numbering 17 including five in Hyderabad are not properly functioning due to shortage of testing kits. \u201cNone of the ICTC units in the state are functioning properly due to gross mismanagement, fund shortage and lack of testing equipment necessary for conducting HIV tests,\u201c alleged Mujtaba Hasan Askari, Managing Trustee & President, NGO Helping Hand Foundation. For the record, Telangana state recorded 11,846 new HIV positive cases in 2016, taking the overall people living with HIVAIDS in the state to 1.73 lakh now."}

I worked for a private firm and was a bachelor then. It felt my world collapsed that moment and from then on, I would just stay in my room, moping over my condition,\u201d he said. Then a friend suggested a visit to Uttar Pradesh Network for people with HIV + & AIDS (UPNP). Mahesh says he felt like he was reborn then. \u201cI married an HIV+ girl in 2011 and how our lives changed! HIV + is not the end of the road but the beginning of a new journey,\u201d says Mahesh. Like Mahesh, there many with HIV+ people who have overcome odds to lead a productive life. When Fatima (35) found out she was HIV+ in 2004, she locked herself inside her room for five days. \u201cMy sister-in-law used to curse me daily... I could hear her even from inside my room. I just wanted to die. Then a TV series gave me hope.\u201d Fatima visited a counselling centre which led her to UPNP. \u201cI got married three years ago and my husband is supportive. We have decided to create awareness about HIV virus. It is not an illness and proper prevention can help the infected person feel better,\u201d she said. \u201cI was thrown out of my job. My colleagues laughed at me, even my own family disowned me,\u201d says 40-year-old Suresh who was diagnosed in 2001. One night, while eating at a dhaba, he met a man who was also an HIV + and life changed thereafter. \u201cHIV+ just requires you to take preventive measures and you can lead a healthy life,\u201d he said. \u201cI have got a good job and have emerged a winner,\u201d he said. UPNP chief Naresh Yadav said HIV+ people were not criminals. It\u2019s just that they were prone to catching infections as the virus weakens their immune system. Dr Himanshu, head of anti-retroviral (ART) therapy centre at KGMU for HIV+, said HIV never spreads by one\u2019s saliva, sweat or urine. It is only transmitted if the blood of the infected person comes in contact with a body. Then, he said, precaution can be taken within 72 hours, known as Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), under which certain medicines reduce the exposure of the virus. He said HIV+ couples can have kids through Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT). There have been over 50 cases where children were born to couples with HIV virus, he said.

The regulator has also allowed leeway to manufacturers for conducting clinical trials or bio-equivalence studies in India. While these studies are conducted to test new drugs on local patients, they take a long time and hence often delays launches in the country. The new norms issued by the regulator allows companies to apply for such studies and product approvals simultaneously, whereas usually companies have to submit data from trials before seeking product approvals. In fact, in some cases the regulator has also suggested waiving off clinical trials for urgent use. \"Clinical trial waiver for such products recommended by WHO for concomitant use may be given, as being falling under the category of extreme urgency and under the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules,\" it said. Though India has demonstrated a 57% reduction in overall annual number of new HIV cases, it continues to have the third highest number of people living with HIV in the world. Similarly, chronic Hepatitis is placing a huge disease, social and economic burden on affected families as well as the health system. The condition can be self-limiting or can progress to liver fibrosis (scarring), cirrhosis or liver cancer. Early approvals in India are also likely to benefit people around the world as India is a major supplier of generic medicines, mainly anti-retroviral."}

Under the new law, central and state governments are obliged to provide for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and management of opportunistic infections (infections that take advantage of weakness in the immune system and occur frequently).

On Saturday, the children were forced to clean a choked drain and locals tipped off Balala Hakkula Sangham, who brought this to the notice of the Rachakonda police commissioner. \"When we entered the premises, we found children were cleaning the premises with broomsticks,\" Balala Hakkula Sangam member Achuta Rao told STOI. \u201cWe are regularly made to do domestic chores by the home authorities. We clean the drain occasionally,\" a girl told reporters. Uppal inspector Y Narasimha Reddy said the accused and victims' statement would be recorded and those responsible for forcing children into manual scavenging would be arrested."}

The Kodambakkam resident is HIV positive and has to forgo a day\u2019s wage to travel to a government hospital in Tambaram. At times when the prescribed medicine is unavailable at the hospital, she has to buy the same from outside at a steeper price. While a weak immune system and lack of a nutritious diet make Siriyapushpam susceptible to frequent bouts of illnesses, she says meeting the increasing medical expense gets harder for her each time. Siriyapushpam\u2019s case is not isolated. A complete absence of insurance cover against opportunistic infections (infections caused due to a weak immune system), affects more than 21 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) across the country, including 1.42 lakh in TN. It has been more than a month since the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act 2014 came into place, but insurers say, they are yet to get guidelines on including such patients in health, life and critical illness segments. The Act protects PLHIV against denial, termination, discontinuation and unfair treatment with regard to employment, educational establishments, healthcare services, residing or renting property, standing for public or private office, and provision of insurance. But without specific instructions, PLHIV in the country remain without cover. According to \u2018India HIV Estimation 2015\u2019 report of National AIDS Control Organisation, there were 21.17 lakh PLHIV, including 86,000 newly infected people in 2015. With the highest prevalence being recorded in Nagaland (1.29%), TN\u2019s prevalence rate (0.27%) was higher than the national average of 0.26%. \"I have seen cases where hospitals have refused to conduct surgeries to remove uterine fibroids on HIV positive persons. Others charge two to three times the actual cost to operate. If an insurance scheme is introduced for PLHIV, there would be some regulation,\" Kousalya Periasamy, founder of NGO Positive Women\u2019s Network. According to a 2006 UNDP study on the socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS in India, a person with HIV bears expenses between `25,000 - `30,000 a year. The situation is worse if the earning member in a family is frequently hospitalised. HIV/AIDS and related complications are excluded from critical insurance covers and insurers say they haven\u2019t received instructions to include it in their policies. Health insurance for groups, however, exists. \"In the group health segment, Cigna TTK offers AIDS/HIV cover up to full sum insured under the global health group policy. It covers Indian locals and expatriates working abroad under one umbrella. This cover is available for employees, dependent spouse and children,\" says Sandeep Patel, CEO and MD, Cigna TTK Health Insurance. Star Health & Allied Insurance provides group cover under the NetPlus policy where the proposal has to come from NGOs or government agencies. However, expenses for HIV treatment are excluded as are people with low CD4 count. \"Only if companies take the initiative and insure PLHIV for frequent hospitalisations and opportunistic infections can insurance create an impact and gain public trust,\" says Dr S Prakash, senior executive director, Star Health and Allied Insurance. Others say the new law is a step in the right direction. \"With more such steps and availability of more data to enable pricing of products, we can look towards greater inclusion,\" says Ashish Mehrotra, MD and CEO, Max Bupa Health Insurance. But for rural households, 72% of who, according to a 2014 NSSO study, rely on private hospitals for treatment, retail insurance continues to be a dream. Dr Sathish Kumar, country doctor for Solidarity and Action Against HIV Infection in India said cover for PLHIV from lower income groups particularly need attention. Presently, the collective gets such PLHIV enrolled in the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY). Under the scheme, PLHIV from BPL families can get free hospitalisation up to \u20b930,000 per family per year. While increasing medical expenses burn a hole in their pockets, patients say unavailability of medicines at ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) centres forces them to make additional trips to the health centre, which robs them of their day\u2019s income. Nutrition is another aspect which seems to have been brushed aside. Dr P Kuganathan, a former programme officer of the state AIDS control programme and consultant (community medicine & infectious disease) at SIMS Hospital says, \"Medicines will work only if PLHIV take nutritious meals,\" adding that the Centre should implement a scheme similar to the mid-day meal for PLHIV. In December 2013, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) announced that people with HIV or other pre-existing illnesses would need to pay a higher premium for life insurance. It also urged companies to continue insuring individuals who contract HIV after buying the policy. This was two months after it issued draft guidelines asking insurers to provide life cover to HIV/AIDS patients. A lot remains to be done, especially in health insurance. At present, an individual with critical injuries or illnesses such as paralysis or cancer is more likely to getting insurance cover than an HIV positive patient on ART."}

A bench, headed by Justice Dipak Misra said the woman, who has already become a destitute, was sexually assaulted and suffered from a serious medical ailment, should not be allowed to go through further sufferings. The medical board has to examine the woman latest by May 6 and place the report by Monday. \u201cAs we are inclined to think that a woman, who has already become a destitute being sexually assaulted and suffering from a serious medical ailment, not to go through further sufferings.

It directed that a representative from NGO Koshish should accompany the woman, who is staying in a shelter home, \u2018Shanti Kutir\u2019 in Patna, and bring her to Delhi. It also directed the additional solicitor generals P S Narasimha and Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, to arrange for her travel and that of the representative accompanying her. The court asked both the law officers to assist the court on the issue and also hold discussion with the doctors, saying, \u201cWe are concerned with saving a life of a destitute woman.\u201d When the matter was taken up for hearing, the bench asked advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for the woman, to ask her whether she was inclined to come to Delhi, to which she replied in the affirmative. The apex court said it would not go into the Patna high court order which had held that the medical board\u2019s report has stated that it would be unsafe for the life of the petitioner and there was a compelling responsibility of the state to keep the child alive. The high court had said the woman\u2019s pregnancy had crossed the legal embargo of 20 weeks under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 and was unsafe to medically terminate her pregnancy. Grover said the high court had failed to appreciate that the woman was 35 years of age and completely fit to make her own reproductive choices without any interference. In her plea, the woman said she was a destitute and had come to know about her pregnancy for the first time around the 13th week and that, too, after she was rescued by Shanti Kutir, a women\u2019s rehabilitation centre, and made to take a pregnancy test on January 26. The woman said she had expressed her desire to terminate her pregnancy on March 4 to a research officer of Koshish, a field action project of Tata Institute of Social Sciences, with whom she was in contact. However, it was only after she revealed to the superintendent of the shelter home that the pregnancy was the outcome of rape, she made attempts to have it terminated at the Patna Medical College and Hospital on March 14. According to the plea, the hospital refused to admit the woman owing to lack of identity proof. To terminate her pregnancy, she approached the high court which constituted a medical board to examine her. The board submitted its report on March 17 which said that termination would involve surgical process which may lead to health complications such as bleeding, anaesthesia hazard and sepsis. In her appeal before the apex court, the woman said her father and husband, who have deserted her, in their respective replies before the high court, had conveyed their consent for termination of pregnancy of the petitioner.

The new act seeks to protect the rights of PLHIV, ensuring there is no discrimination against them in healthcare services, education, employment, public facilities, holding public office, property rights and insurance. Under the act, hospitals including private will not be permitted to delay surgery or charge different rates for services for PLHIV. \u201cThis would amount to discrimination as it imposes a burden on a person based on HIV related grounds,\u201d senior advocate and director of the lawyers collective Anand Grover said. He was delivering a public lecture on demystifying HIV & AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill 2017 at the International Centre, Goa organised by the Lawyers Collective and Positive People in anticipation of the latter\u2019s 25th anniversary. In cases of discrimination in healthcare, a PLHIV can first complain to the establishment\u2019s complaints authority to bring the problem to its notice and get it rectified, he says. If this doesn\u2019t work, a PLHIV can approach an ombudsman appointed by the state government under this act to inquire into complaints of discrimination and provision of healthcare services where he/she is expected to pass orders within 24 hours of the receipt of the complaint in medical emergency cases. A state must appoint at least one ombudsman. There is also no reason why insurance premium should be double for PLHIV, Grover says, pointing out that the denial or unfair treatment in providing insurance also amounts to discrimination, provided this is supported by actuarial studies. The act also requires that no person be compelled to disclose his HIV status except with his informed consent and if required by a court order where establishments maintaining records of HIV positive persons must adopt data protection measures. Grover who fought for the rights of Dominic D\u2019Souza, one of India\u2019s first HIV activists and the first case that went to court more than two-and-a-half decades ago, says this new act originated in D\u2019Souza\u2019s fight.

The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) previously recommended ART only for those HIV-positive people whose CD4 count (measure of a type of white blood cells) was less than 350 cell millimeter cube on two occasions three months apart. The new 'test and treat' policy means MDACS has to find the 8,000 people who got themselves tested at various government-run testing centres over the last few years, but were not put on ART because they didn't fulfill the previous NACO guidelines. At present, 33,000 positive people are on ART in Mumbai. \u201cWe have asked the various Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) in the city to compile a list of people who tested positive at their centre but are not on ART,\u201c said MDACS additional project director Dr Srikala Acharya. Considering that ICTCs gets a mixed crowd including migrants, it is not likely to be an easy exercise. \u201cWe not only have to locate them, we have to get a fresh CD4 count done. Thereafter, we have to counsel them about taking ART,\u201c said Dr Acharya. The HIV virus remains asymptomatic for years, and it's only when the viral load increases beyond a limit that HIV-positive people start exhibiting outward symptoms such as weight loss and poor immunity against diseases. \u201cAdherence will be a big issue because why would asymptomatic HIV-positive people take strong medicines like ART,\u201c said infectious diseases specialist and immunologist Dr Om Srivastava.People need to be counseled about the benefits of ART in the long run (see box). Latest research published in the Lancet said life expectancy for young HIV-positive adults has risen by 10 years in the United States and Europe due to antiretroviral therapy. \u201cThis meant many patients can expect to live as long as those without HIV,\u201c said the Lancet report. Moreover, there could an increase in drug resistance if positive people start ART and discontinue it mid-way. \u201cIndia has to be ready for people developing resistance to firstand second-line drugs. Adequate stocks of secondand third-line drugs should be maintained,\u201c said Dr Srivastava, who said the private sector had started its 'test and treat' policy over two years ago. However, MDACS's Dr Acharya said that there were adequate stocks of all ART drug combinations in Mumbai.

However, from this week, USACS will provide free drugs to all 5,527 patients. In another welcome move, USACS has decided to help poor patients in getting subsidized food grains from district food offices. Also, the destitute will not have to endure long queues and will be helped by officials at ART centres. These officials will coordinate with district food officers for getting ID cards for the patients. Gagan Luthra, who is a project officer with USACS, said, \u201cBoth these initiatives are equally important. In majority of the cases, HIV positive patients are abandoned by their families. Some of the poor patients suffer from poverty and hunger which deteriorates their health. The food security provided to them will ensure that they do not suffer due to hunger.\u201d HIV positive patients in the state have been demanding food and travel subsidy for a long time. One of their primary demands is that of travel pass. \u201cWe often miss out on medication as we are unable to travel to other parts of the city or the state for check-ups. Most of the times, we don\u2019t have the money to travel and hence a travel pass is very important for us,\u201d said an HIV positive patient from Dehradun."}

But the money an astrologer earns from this unique practice undoubtedly serves a good social cause. With the income he makes, astrologer Vijay supports at least 30 HIV-infected children in his village in Erode district. Astrology's purpose, according to Vijay, is to interpret the positions of the planets and stars in the sky to gather information on an individual. But in his social life, it goes beyond that. Vijay learnt the art after studying in detail the lines and patterns on one's big toe. For him, it all began at the age of 18. Today, he has read the lines on more than 4,500 big toes of people from different walks of life. Solutions may vary, but it's his devotion for this rare field of astrology that still brings people to his village called Avalpunthurai, 12 km from Erode. As a child, Vijay was different from his friends. Besides being a staunch devotee of lord Shiva, he was fond of dogs, considered the vahana (vehicle) of the lord. To express his devotion towards dogs, he even ran a shelter for dogs in his village. \"I was a devotee of Shiva from my childhood. When I grew up, I used to dream of the lord. It was in one such dream that I got the idea of toe-reading,\" said Vijay, who was in Chennai recently. Vijay takes the print of one's big toe and studies the various lines on it. \"It takes four to five hours in some cases, but I could give solutions to most people who have approached me so far,\" he said. But learning to read the lines on one's big toe was not easy as Vijay didn't have any basic training on astrology. When he turned 18, Vijay started studying toe-prints of people and conducted research on how they are related to one's past and present. Vijay first started taking the toe-prints of some drunkards in his village. He then started analyzing the lines on the big toes of people who are suffering from health problems. It took a couple of years for him to understand the difference between the lines found on toes of people suffering from various issues. \"People in my village thought I was mad. And my strong faith in lord Shiva was another reason for them to feel so. But I didn't look back. I studied the toe-prints of more than 1,000 people during my research. It was after getting a clear understanding about the subject, I began reading the big toes of people and started giving solutions to their problems,\" said 38-year-old Vijay. What makes Vijay truly different, however, is the noble act that he does for the HIV-infected children in his village. \"I am not doing toe-reading for money. I am doing this under the instruction from my god. The money is used for the welfare of some 30 HIV-infected children in my village,\" he said. Besides, the Sri Bhairava Foundation, under his chairmanship, has contributed to a number of heart operations, particularly for children, conducted in and around Erode."}

These are among the 12,058 new patients added to the HIV/AIDS caseload over the past 12 months. Drugs like heroin, cocaine, MDMA (ecstasy) - known as street-drugs are commonly injected despite the high risk of contracting AIDS. In fact, one in 23 women and one in 36 men, who inject drugs have a risk of contracting AIDS, health authorities say. Overall, the state has an estimated 400 such AIDS patients who contacted the dreaded virus through intravenous drug injections. Apart from the street drugs, even prescription drugs like tablets, capsules and liquids are injected occasionally, say insiders. \"Drug abusers often begin with taking pills or snorting drugs in the powdered form, slowly graduate to the intravenous method. Most of the abusers are obsessed with being on a perpetual high. Over time, the usage of pills, capsules, puffing and snorting slowly reduce the impact and hence they switch to intravenous drugs,\" said an official at the Narcotics Control Bureau. These injectable drugs are often make from powder or crystal form of drugs by dissolving them in water. Sometimes it is even heated up if required and later drawn in to the syringe by dipping a cotton ball into the solution. \"The fact that many of the drug users also have unsafe sexual practices, increase the risk of HIV due to sharing of the syringes,\" added the official. Apart from getting a high, there are many more reasons why addicts graduate to intravenous drugs say experts, even if it comes with the highest risk of contracting AIDS as well as other blood-related infections. \"The type of injected drug are opioids- the most well-known of which is heroin. Other opioid medicines that IV drugs users frequently abuse are fentanyl, Talwin and buprenorphine, as well as the prescription painkillers oxycodone and hydrocodone (the latter two are first crushed into a powder and then dissolved into a solution for injection),\" added Dr Rahul Agarwal, senior consultant internal medicine, Maxcure hospitals. Stimulants are popular with IV drug users because they quickly deliver a strong feeling of euphoria, as well as increased energy, reduced appetite and a reduced need for sleep. \"People who repeatedly snort suffer discomfort due to perforation of nasal mucosa, sinusitis, nose bleeds, loss of sense of smell, problems in swallowing and hoarseness,\" he added."}

Furthermore, as the embassy said, there is a great potential for people-to-people and cultural exchanges between Japan and the north-east with Japan\u2019s historical connection with the region. \u201cAgainst this background, Japan and India launch the Coordination Forum in order to explore and expand cooperation in the North Eastern Region, and to strengthen the relationship between Japan and North East as well as that between Japan and India,\u2019\u2019 said the statement. Japan has been working in India\u2019s north-east for a while but it is also looking to partner India in infrastructure projects in India\u2019s neighbourhood. The two countries are working together for development of infrastructure and connectivity for the Chabahar port in Iran."}

Besides not releasing the salaries, MSACS has asked the NGOs for curtailing staff by almost 50% from back date (April 2017 onwards) without issuing any retrenchment warnings or notices. The NGOs are on warpath and are planning to register their opposition to this on Wednesday with a joint protest. \u201cThis is not the situation with just Nagpur. About 3,500 persons from the 157 projects in the state have not got the salaries for last eight months. Since authorities have been continually assuring that the salaries would come soon for all this period, many workers have borrowed money, mortgaged their gold etc to run the families. And now all of a sudden, the authorities are asking us to reduce the staff. Since no one has got the salary and everyone has been working all this while, whom do the project officers throw out,\u201d said Nikunj Joshi, CEO of Sarathi project. Hemlata Lohave, project in charge from the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS), says that reducing the staff would double the job of the existing workers. The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) is promoting zero deaths due to AIDS. \u201cHow will this be possible with such drastic curtailment of staff? The staff reduction has come to us as a surprise. No one is prepared for it. NGOs were not taken into confidence while planning the Annual Action Plan (AAP) and now they have laid new targets under the AAP. This is simply not acceptable. As per the contract both parties are expected to give one month\u2019s notice before removing from job or leaving the job,\u201d she said. Nanda Adamane, project head of the Bhartiya Adim Jati Sevak Sangh, told TOI that it was very difficult on the organization\u2019s front to throw out workers without paying their salaries. \u201cRetrenchment would also mean doubling of target population under each worker. This is physically not feasible,\u201d she said. The MSACS joint director Lokesh Gabhane admitting certain flaws in the system however told TOI that the salaries from December 2016 to march 2017 had not been given as MSACS didn\u2019t get the required funds from NACO. \u201cWe understand the problem of the workers. MSACS has been in touch with NAC. Actually the AAP was finalized in June this year and hence the delay in release of salaries for the financial year 2017-18. We can expect the release of funds in another few days. Hence we are telling the NGOs to first pay the workers first whom they plan to retrench from the money that has been released for April to July. No one will be thrown out without wages. The remaining staff will have to bear with the delay but they too will surely get the salaries after NACO releases the funds,\u201d Gabhane told TOI. Gabhane said that NGOs will have to retrench staff based on their performance. \u201cThe reduction is staff is just 10-20%. The NGOs are exaggerating it to 50%. But this is true that they will have to reduce some staff from each project,\u201d he said."}

The incident immediately brought to the activist\u2019s notice the absence of effective tools to help a person in danger in ways that were quick, efficient and self-reliant. Thus was born the idea for an app that could systematically deliver various kinds of assistance to a survivor of gender-based violence. The app \u2018Saahas\u2019 was launched in June this year. Cashing in on the versatility of smart phone applications, app makers have for a while now, exploited the freedom to transmit GPS-identified locations to offer wide-ranging SOS and emergency contact services for women. But now, the time is to fine-tune these services, believe activists. \"I wanted to create an app that could tell where to get help when in danger, and also enable bystander intervention,\" says Jayakumar. \"We work on educating bystanders, so that they can identify signs in an individual to know when they are facing violence. For a survivor to speak up is an act of courage. But for a bystander, to intervene is both an act of courage and knowledge,\" she adds. Saahas has had 719 downloads so far, of which 62% have been in India. It has nine verticals, including police and ambulance helplines, consulates and embassies helplines, medical and legal help, and child and refugee-specific support. While new ways of addressing old challenges is the key, equally essential is to operate existing mechanisms with better efficiency, believes city-based women\u2019s rights NGO Aware, which has partnered with popular safety audit and tracking app, Safetipin, in a new campaign. Aware\u2019s collaboration with Safetipin is part of its campaign \u2018Safe Cities\u2019, which in turn is a spillover of its \u2018nomorenirbhaya\u2019 campaign. While Safetipin was launched in 2013, Aware found that the app\u2019s reach in Chennai was still limited to a few users. \"We had already planned to conduct safety audits in the city, but realised that the app would make it easier to record the data and generate a comprehensive report,\" says Sandhiyan Thilagavathy, founder, Aware. Safetipin allows the user to measure and record the safety standard of a location, by conducting a safety audit of the area, based on nine parameters that the app enlists \u2014 from lighting in the area and visibility, to walk paths, security and gender diversity. It also has a personal safety tracker feature. \"Based on the reports generated from our audits, we will be able to follow up with the respective authorities to introduce changes; for instance, if an area doesn\u2019t have sufficient lighting, we will submit a petition to the municipal corporation, or in case of inadequate security, we will touch base with the concerned police station and ask officials to conduct regular patrolling during late hours. In order to get a clear picture of the situation, we conduct the audits only post 6pm,\" says Thilagavathy. She acknowledges that mobilising the public to consistently use the app and conduct safety audits in their neighbourhoods, schools and colleges isn\u2019t easy. \"We are working towards building the strength of our volunteers, who will reach out to their respective communities to educate people on the app,\" says Thilagavathy. Aware plans to connect with residential associations and the Shrimathi Devkunvar Nanalal Bhatt Vaishnav College for Women in Chromepet to educate residents and students about the app and mobilise volunteers."}

The move is, however, being seen as a \u2018ridiculous\u2019 one by social activists as they see it as an infringement of privacy of people living with HIV. When a 45-year-old HIV patient reached Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre at Sawai Man Singh Hospital to get medicines, the healthcare staff asked her to submit Aadhaar card\u2019s photocopy. \u201cThey asked me if I have Aadhaar card and that I should submit its photocopy,\u201d the patient who is taking medicine for HIV for over 10 years, said. The RSACS has sent messages to all its ART centres, which provide medicines to people with HIV/AIDS across the state, to collect Aadhaar from beneficiaries. \u201cOther departments are also linking social benefit schemes with Aadhaar, so we have also decided to link it. But, we have not made it compulsory for getting medicines. If a person does not have Aadhaar, he/she will continue to get medicines. We will not stop providing them medicines,\u201d said Dr S S Chauhan, director, RSACS. In the state, there are 23 ART centres that provide testing and treatment facilities to 55,000 odd people living with HIV. Officials said that Aadhaar will help in keeping a track on beneficiaries (people living with HIV), who go missing during treatment. Also, through Aadhaar, department will ensure that a particular beneficiary is not registered at different ART centres. They will generate a whole database online, which will have their Aadhaar number. If a person goes to an ART for HIV testing, the online software through Aadhaar will detect automatically if he is already registered at some other ART. Reacting on it, social activists are apprehensive that this may increase risk of revealing identity of people living with HIV/AIDS. \u201cHIV is a severe privacy issue. But it has been seen in the past that your Aadhaar is compromised at many places. There are instances of it being stolen. The question arises that how the state government will keep such database safe,\u201d said activist Nikhil Dey. Dey said, \u201cOnce it\u2019s leaked, how they (those who get it) will use it. There is a stigma attached to HIV, so it is ridiculous to collect Aadhaar from those who are already marginalised. If they made it mandatory, there are chances of exclusion of those who do not have Aadhaar from getting benefits of government schemes.\u201d Social activists termed the step as \u201cridiculous\u201d. Collecting Aadhaar from all people living with HIV/AIDS is quite challenging at a time when such people living with HIV/AIDS registered at ART do not share even their original name and address to ensure their original identity is not revealed to anyone, even at ART centres."}

Experts point that several national surveys, including the National Family Health Survey and the District Health Surveys, have pointed to low HIVAIDS awareness among people which could have led to an increase in late referrals, high dropout rates and poor treatment outcomes.It could also be because of a spike in death among those diagnosed with AIDS more than adecade ago, officials say."}

The recent survey also found that more than half the women (59%) who use office transport in Bengaluru do so between 8pm and 8am. However, Bengaluru stood third, after Chennai and Mumbai, in this regard among the six cities surveyed. The analysis of 9 lakh rides by MoveInSync, which enables companies manage employee transportation, was done in the backdrop of rampant harassment of women in trains and railway platforms, efforts to improve gender diversity at workplaces and more women opting to join companies in night shifts, especially those providing transportation. The rides were analyzed during July 2017. In Bengaluru, 3.64 lakh rides were analyzed, while in Chennai and Hyderabad, 1.13 lakh and 1.72 lakh rides were studied. Only 91,000 and 80,000 rides were analysed in Pune and Mumbai. \u201cNone of these six cities have a solid public transport system at night. Safety is not just the concern of woman employees but the employer too which is why we see wom en working after 8pm in IT ITES banking sectors being provided cabs to go home,\u201c Deepesh Agarwal, founder, MoveInSync, said. The research found that women feel more comfortable with tech-driven safety measures. \u201cCompanies do provide private security personnel to escort employees to pick up or drop at odd hours but if employees have an app on their phones through which they can alert their office about the ride or have panic button systems in cabs or apps, they feel more secure,\u201c Agarwal told TOI. Wipro said it not only provides transport for employees during odd hours in accordance with the law but also ensures they reach home safe by adding multi ple layers of security. About 35%-36% of its women employees work between 8pm and 8am in ITITES and support functions. \u201cWe have installed GPS with panic buttons and hooters in all our vehicles. The moment a woman traveller presses the panic button, the shrill hooter goes on for three minutes so that other vehicles around are alerted. We also have algorithms to ensure the woman employee is not the second drop and the second pick up in case the first employee is a no-show. We also give automated calls to an employee if she is dropped at her destination even five minutes later than the estimate,\u201c Nittan Bhalla, GM and head of facilities, Wipro, said. The research analyzed shiftwise details. \u201cWhile women seem to make their own arrangements for reaching office in the morning, they use company provided transport to reach home at night,\u201c it revealed. It found that compared to men, women seem to stay closer to office \u00ad they travel a lesser distance and hence take lesser time to reach office. Sarmila Karmakar, an ITES employee in Manyata Tech Park, admitted she felt safe because of the transportation provided by her firm.\u201cApart from a security guard, we have an app through which the office management tracks our ride and we can alert them if the driver takes a longer route, drops me last or misbehaves, among other things,\u201c she said. TIMES VIEW Women using office transport for the commute to work feel secure when their organisations go the extra mile to ensure their safety. It's heartening to know that some organisations have multiple layers of security in place and this can make all the difference. It's now up to all companies to pick up the best practices available and pre-empt any incidents of harassment. Sensitising cab drivers, doing thorough background checks, constantly updating their system and cracking down when required are an absolute must for managers of office transportation."}

The place where she celebrated the birthday was not a hotel but a care home for children living with HIV/AIDS. The building was constructed with funds Malzner raised over the past five years from Austria to give a permanent residence to 40-odd children, who lost their parents to HIV/AIDS. These children have been living rented homes for the past 12 years and forced to shift at least 15 times. The birthday celebration was made special as the new building for the care home was inaugurated on the same day. \u201cI will never forget this birthday,\u201d Malzner told ToI. Malzner raised 60,000 Euros on her own and persuaded an organisation called Karibu World, which chipped in with 60,000 Euros for the care home. \u201cI raised 60,000 Euros and Karibu World also contributed an equal amount. Since Karibu World receives funds from the Austrian government, we can say that the government too helped in the construction of the building,\u201d she said. It was a challenging task for Malzner to raise funds in her country. \u201cI faced problems initially. But then I showed them my presentation, why I was doing it and they developed trust in me,\u201d said Malzner. Malzner has a restaurant and also a shop in Hirschbach Im M\u00fchlkreis, Oberosterreich, Austria. She also had many friends in the restaurant business. On her request, they agreed to donate amounts ranging from one Euro to five Euros per soup sold at theier establishments to Malzner. \u201cI also sold scarfs in Austria which I took from India. The margin I got was donated to for the cause. I also organised parties, including dance events and food festivals, and asked participants to contribute,\u201d Malzner said.

It was not my aim to construct a building for such children. But, after spending four weeks in Kotpulti Nagar, I wanted to do more good work.

People of all walks of life make it a point to celebrate this festival. With increasing social concerns, people prefer to lace their celebrations with a good deed. A group of like-minded people started working a fortnight ahead of Diwali to collate whatever they could like money and clothes and distribute them among the orphans and elderly. This year too, they collected the materials but there was a certain delay due to GST and finances were tight. Padikattugal, a youth forum in the city distributed clothes and sweets to children affected with HIV. They have been doing it for last five years. For the past three years, they set up a stall in one of the textile showrooms to collect money or clothes from people shopping in the textiles outlet. After required money is mobilised, they take the children from orphanages for shopping before the shop opens for public. This year, however, there was considerable delay in collating money and clothes. \u201cWe could not take children for shopping. Most of them donate food on Diwali days, but clothes, sweets and crackers make their Diwali which is the reason we collect these goodies for them,\u201d said S Malaisamy, managing trustee of Padikattugal. In spite of financial constraints, generosity of willing public surpasses the difficulties, quipped V P Manikandan, a social worker in the city. \u201cIt is true that money was tight this year but good-hearted people do contribute whatever they can\u201d, he mentioned. On Wednesday, Manikandan along with volunteers and social workers will be visiting couple of orphanages and old age homes to celebrate Deepavali. \u201cMore than goodies, the rejected lot of society enjoy company of people. There are some to remember them\u201d, he added. Even ahead of Diwali, a group of transgenders celebrated the festival with the corporation home for destitutes at Uthangudi. As many as 150 students from Maharishi Vidhya Mandir School, Kovilpappakudi decided to celebrate the festival with differently-abled children. On Monday, they visited Able Kids Special School at Arapalayam. They conducted cultural programmes for these special children and they had a great time together."}

Acting on a complaint from the parents, police scoured footage from CCTV cameras in Geddalahalli. Some cameras had captured images of the children walking with Vinod, 25, a ragpicker from the locality, and police registered a case of kidnap and escalated investigations. Police said after school, the children would come to their grandfather, who also sold tender coconuts in Geddalahalli, and hang around. The children knew Vinod, who often visited their grandfather and brought them sweets. On the day of the kidnap, he lured the kids with the promise of sweets, and took them to Tirupati. Sanjayanagar police said they requested their father Prashanth to send photographs of the children to all his friends and relatives. Prashanth took his friend Avinash's help to send the missing children's picture to as many people as they could. One of the recipients of Avinash's message was a friend, Venkatesh, who lives in Tirupati. Coincidentally, Vinod who had headed to Tirupati with the children, met Venkatesh and asked him for a job. He introduced the children as his own. Venkatesh realized who the children were after he saw the WhatsApp message from Avinash. Venkatesh alerted Avinash. Soon, a team of Sanjayanagar police rushed to Tirupati and rescued the children from Vinod. Police said Vinod managed to escape before they reached the spot, leaving the children behind, and that they have no clue why he had kidnapped the children. Police claimed the children had not been harassed by the abductor, except being forced to call him their dad. Shailaja, their mother, said, \"We don't know Vinod.

The unprecedented turn of events left the patient, with an extremely low haemoglobin count and her relatives shaken. \u201cI was told by Sultania hospital doctors to return to the government hospital in Sehore, where I gave birth to a baby.

District Program Manager (DPM) of DAPCU, Trichy Dr SM Manivannan says, \u201cThe trend has changed after 2011. Analysis shows that the trend is a consequence of illicit affairs among married people. But on the whole, the prevalence of HIV-AIDS is declining.\u201d Earlier, the incidence was prevalent among people in the age group of 30 to 39 years, due to the unawareness of the high risk behavior groups - Female Sex Workers (FSW), Men Sex with Men (MSM) and transgender (TG). \u201cHIV positive was high among the risk behavior groups, but after 2011 the trend declined and common people too have been tested positive,\u201d said Dr Manivannan.

In 2014, the plight of HIV-infected children in the state came to light when 13 HIV-infected orphans were expelled from a school in Rivona after parents of other students discovered their condition and demanded they not be allowed to study in the school. The students also had to change schools twice due to the objection raised by parents of other children. When a Delhi-based NGO petitioned the Supreme Court, and the apex court ruled in March this year that states include HIV-infected children in the disadvantaged group under RTE, the Goa government was forced to act on those lines. While the court had appreciated 11 states and union territories for already including HIV-infected children as a disadvantaged group, it turned out Goa was among the states that had not protected these children under the RTE Act, even though Goa notified its RTE rules seven years ago, in 2010. The state finally issued the notification in September this year. The extension of protected status to children in Goa living with or infected with HIV means that they are now entitled to special protection and measures under the terms of the RTE Act. These include eradication of discrimination, harassment, and victimisation. It will eliminate discrimination in relation to the admissions process including denying or limiting access to any benefits of enrolment or through segregation in separate study, sports, playground or canteen areas or in any other amenities provided by the school.

Of the 80,173 people who died of the disease, only 60,208 were provided antiretroviral therapy by the government, while the rest 19,965 were left out as they were not deemed eligible for the treatment. \u201cHow come this data is not available on the website?

This was stated in the 2016-17 report of Thane\u2019s District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU). However, there has been a drop in the number of cases in the entire district. The officials claimed that Thane city, comprising of Thane, Mira Road and Bhayander, had more people who belong to the high risk population. Navi Mumbai and Bhiwandi were among the top three places in the district that were detected with the most number of cases. \u201cThese cities not only have a high population, but also have people from the high risk zone \u2014like sex workers, migrants, transgenders, truck drivers, etc. It was also seen that out of the ones who were detected positive, 80% got infected due to unsafe sex. While others got it through blood transfusion. Though 110 pregnant women were detected HIV positive in 2016-17, the number has decreased as compared to the 2015-16 figures that stood at 153 women affected with the virus. This drop is because of the awareness drives being carried out by various organisations,\u201d said Ratan Gadhave, district programme officer of theDAPCU. The department, along with 33 NGOs, conduct awareness drives on regular basis and focus more on the people belonging to the high risk communities. \u201cOut of those who fall under the high risk category, the highest number of people tested positive were migrant workers and and truck drivers. But there has been a rise in the number of patients taking the HIV test. This is because of the awareness drives we have been carrying out in these pockets. During these drives, we request those infected with the virus to come to the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre for tests,\u201d said Gadhave. However, there has been a drop in HIV positive cases in the district. This is an indication that the awareness drives and sensitization programmes organized by the state authorities and voluntary groups in the last seven years has shown positive results. While there were 5,154 HIV cases in 2010-11, the numbers came down to around 2,304 in 2016-2017."}

In another part of the country, a blood transfusion brought Radhika\u2019s* dreams crashing down. But instead of letting their HIV+ve diagnoses fill their lives with negativity, they decided to stay positive. Brought together by a twist of fate and the late Dr Suniti Solomon, the pioneer of AIDS research in India, the couple is now proud parents to a 16-year-old, and productive members of society. \"When I was first diagnosed with HIV, I was terrified,\" says Chennai-based Arun, who was referred to Dr Solomon of YRG CARE. \"She reassured me that I could still lead a normal life as long as I took medication, and adopted a healthy lifestyle. Getting to know other people living with HIV helped me overcome my fears,\" says Arun, who gave up smoking and drinking. Two years later, when Dr Solomon asked him if he was looking for a life partner, Arun was ready to take the next step forward. \"I hadn\u2019t told my parents or siblings that I am HIV+ve so they were keen to see me married. I wanted a companion but didn\u2019t want to spoil the life of another person, so I decided to marry a woman who was also HIV+ve,\" says Arun, an engineer. Dr Solomon, who documented the first cases of HIV in India in 1986 among sex workers, took voluntary retirement in 1993 to establish YRG Care. In the latter part of her career \u2014 as people began living longer with generic anti-retroviral medications and faced the same pressure at home to get married \u2014 she began helping healthy patients find life partners. Though the centre has played \u2018matchmaker\u2019 for 30 couples so far, Arun and Radhika\u2019s was the first success story. With Dr Solomon\u2019s encouragement, Arun decided to meet prospective brides. That\u2019s when Dr Solomon heard about Radhika, a young woman from Maharashtra. And once Arun met her and her family, he was quick to make up his mind. Radhika, who takes tuitions at home, was also willing to take the plunge. \"I didn\u2019t want to be alone for the rest of my life, and wanted the emotional support a partner can give,\" she says. The next hurdle was convincing his parents who were still unaware that he is HIV+ve. Arun\u2019s family was quick to come around and the only barrier was language. But there was another, bigger challenge ahead. The couple, who got married in July 2001, discovered that Radhika was pregnant in September. \"We were scared but both of us were on medication and our son, born in 2002, is HIV-ve,\" says Arun. Till today, they have not disclosed their HIV+ve identity to friends, Arun\u2019s family, or their son. \"There is still some stigma attached to the disease as people have misconceptions about it,\" says Radhika. \"But there is nothing to fear. We take our medicines every day, eat healthy and go to the hospital every six months to check our CD4 (white blood cell counts) and viral loads,\" says Radhika. Arun says getting married and having a child has given direction to his life. \"If you live on your own, you can get depressed. My outlook to life changed after marriage, and now I have a son to live and work for, which gives purpose to my life,\" he says. He has just one word of advice for people. \"If you are in the high-risk group, do go to the doctor and get an HIV test done. With timely and regular treatment, you can lead a normal life.\" (*Names have been changed to protect identity)"}

The test essentially tells whether the treatment regimen is working or not by measuring the amount of HIV virus in a patient\u2019s blood. The National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) has already shortlisted laboratories across the country that would be scaled up to carry out the tests. However, it may be a while before every patient on antiretroviral therapy (ART) qualifies to undergo the expensive test, which costs between Rs 6,000 and Rs 8,000 in a private laboratory. In 2013, the WHO had recommended the viral load-test be carried out within six months of starting an individual on ART and be repeated at the end of that year. Subsequently, it should be carried out annually. People living with HIV and NGOs have since been fighting for the test to be made routinely available and more accessible. \u201cFrom February onward, 532 ART centres across the country will have the viral load-testing facility. In the initial phases, it will be offered to children below the age of five years, people taking treatment for five years and those suffering from HIV-TB co-infection. They have been chosen keeping the criticality of their condition in mind. The test will subsequently be available to all 1.2 million people on ART treatment in the country,\u201d said Dr R S Gupta of NACO\u2019s Care, Support and Treatment division. The civic-run KEM and Nair hospitals are likely to be the centres in the city. Currently, the test is selectively offered at the state-run JJ Hospital, where patients have to go through the stringent scrutiny of a committee. \u201cThe body takes between four and six months only to decide who will undergo the test. It\u2019s unfortunate that in the absence of a viral load-test, the programme solely relies on CD4 count,\u201d said Ganesh Acharya, a member of the Mumbai Aids Forum (MAF). CD4 is an indicator of the body\u2019s immune system. \u201cBut it\u2019s only part information about what the virus is doing with the immune system. A high viral load in the body will usually, but not always, mean a low CD4 count,\u201d said infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who recommends viral load-testing every six months to one year. \u201cBecause of the unavailability of the test, patients also often don\u2019t realize when they have become resistant to the first line or second line drugs,\u201d said Poonam Patkar, secretary of MAF. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) India that offers viral load-testing to KEM patients as a special model, run in collaboration with the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), said they have got great results in picking treatment failures early and improving outcomes by addressing non-adherence in patients. The MSF data collated from KEM has shown that 90% of the patients were responding to the treatment offered under the national programme as their viral loads were suppressed."}

It has been conceptualised by Peter Borges, founder and CEO of the NGO, Human Touch. \u201cThis club will help young people allocate time to tend to their emotional needs at a critical juncture in their life, where establishing peer relationships is particularly important. Unlike other teenagers, there is a heightened risk among HIV+ adolescents to feel excluded and isolated. They are at a far greater risk of not seeking treatment, or dropping out once treatment begins,\u201d Borges says. There are around 310 children known to be living with HIV in the state, of which around 200 belong to the adolescent age group (10-19 years). A majority live with their families, sometimes with single parents and extended families. There are also a substantial number of orphans, close to 40 of whom are housed in three institutions in Tivim, Cavelossim and Rivona. Although ALHIV still face great difficulties in having their voices heard, they also have the potential to be powerful agents of change. Bloom and Blossom, which will conduct its meetings in the Human Touch office at Agasaim, could be a good place to start. \u201cThey will better placed to advocate issues that concern them and should be given opportunities for engagement in policy-making, too. In recent years, discussions on the health such youngsters have taken centrestage at many national and international forums. There is also a demand for a revitalized community-wide response to support them,\u201d Borges says. \u201cAdequate treatment, literacy and the right to make decisions about one\u2019s own health are central to empowering ALHIV to be able to engage in decisions about their own care.

The facts were revealed by Dr Pramod Deoraj, an official from Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) on the occasion of World AIDS Day that falls on December 1. Deoraj said, \u201cThe high rates of positive cases and deaths in the past were because earlier we had fewer ART centres, less medicine stock and not every HIV positive patient received free drugs from government due to criteria called CD4.\u201d An official notification on May 5 this year made it possible to \u201ctreat all\u201d living with HIV regardless of their CD4 cell count (a test that measures the strength of one\u2019s immune system). It has further contributed to decline of new cases. Deoraj said, \u201cWithin the state there were about 23,000 HIV+ve patients who couldn\u2019t get the treatment because of this criteria. With the new guidelines, the government has CD4 clause and we are having a good start.

Treatment for co-infection like tuberculosis is easily available and it is not the case for co-morbidities like tooth ache, heart and kidney problems, claim sources. After the National Community Care Centre scheme, which reserved 10 beds for HIV patients and offered free treatment, was scrapped in 2012, treatment for HIV patients has taken a beating, sources add. AIDS programme Officer (in-charge) Dr C Suvarna admitted that the issue of delayed treatment was raised at a meeting but specific instances were not brought up to them. \u201cNo one can deny treatment and in such a case one can complain to us,\u201d she said. The officer however claimed that for medical reasons treatment could have been delayed or postponed. \u201cMoreover, surgeries have to be done under extra care and it would take some time. We can analyse if the case was brought to us and whether it is \u2018willful\u2019 delay or not,\u201d she said. Stats: ** A total of 18,175 persons have been affected with HIV in Mysuru district. Of them 14,470 are registered with the ART centre at KR Hospital, 2,624 with Asha Kirana Hospital and 1,081 with JSS hospital. ** HIV prevalence is 0.7 % in Mysuru.

Times View UP State AIDS Control Society and KGMU being at variance over data regarding prevalence of HIV-AIDS in the state is a matter of serious concern. KGMU, with its advanced NAT method of blood testing, considered the gold standard, is better placed than UPSACS which is straddled with Elisa test alone. The state should work towards upgrading its infrastructure so that NAT method is introduced as soon as possible. A more realistic survey would present the correct picture, which will result in dealing with the problem with greater alacrity, reach out to more patients and bigger aid that is actually needed. If we do not accurately know how big the problem is, it\u2019s solution will always fall short of the requirement. ( Simran Tandon)"}

The process of initiating every HIV positive individual on antiretroviral treatment (ART), however, has been fraught with difficulties ranging from refusals and adherence issues to side-effects. In Maharashtra, around 33,500 people were identified in the pre-ART category that includes those who are positive but not in immediate need of medicines due to good immunity levels. Out of that, the state has managed to contact around 21,000 people and initiate less than half on treatment. Earlier, ART would be given only after the CD4 levels dropped to 500. \u201cThose with higher immunity levels are reluctant to take medicines daily on the ground that they do not suffer from any symptoms. We are reaching out to them through our social workers and NGOs,\u201d said Parimal Singh, project director of Maharashtra District Aids Control Society (MSACS). The WHO had recommended the treat-all policy so that people living with HIV could lead healthier lives and cut down transmissibility. The Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) has been facing similar issues. Around 1,400 patients from the city have been added under the treat-all policy. \u201cAdherence is a problem that we are trying to tackle. Under the treat-all policy, even those with higher CD4 levels are started on treatment. Some of them have stopped treatment after suffering side-effects. Their contention being they were healthier before starting ART,\u201d said Dr Shrikala Acharya, assistant project director of MDACS. \u201cHowever, to prevent problems of drug resistance, we have started rigorous counselling before initiation of treatment,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) administrator Mark Green, while speaking at an event on Friday, said, \u201cNew HIV infections in India have reduced by 66% since 2000.

The 36-year-old mother of two dug into his bag to find a sari, a lipstick and wilted flowers. Her husband, she later found, was a bisexual cross-dresser. Four years on, Savitha remains married to the same man. Her voice \u2014 narrating her husband\u2019s affairs with other men \u2014 is among those documented by researchers who studied HIV-related risks among married men who have sex with men (MSM) and their wives. According to a 2012 study by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), MSM are at 12 to15 times higher risk of contracting HIV compared to other men. The recent study found that the HIV-related risks for the spouses of MSM were multiple, yet they are not covered under any intervention programmes of the government. Forty six MSMs were interviewed across five states including the cities of Chennai and Madurai. Of these, 13 women were aware of their husbands\u2019 sexual orientation. Men in these marriages were the primary decision-makers about sex and condom use. \"The men used condoms inconsistently with their male partners,\" said Sunil Solomon of Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education, a co-author of the study. \"The women in these relationships are vulnerable but rarely feature in the country\u2019s HIV intervention programmes. The initiatives mostly address the experiences and perspectives of husbands and their male partners, but not their wives,\" said Solomon, who facilitated the interviews for two teams from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Durham University. The few women who were interviewed said they came to know about their husbands\u2019 same-sex preference by accident. The men in the study reported having multiple male, and a few female, extramarital sexual partners. Forty-year-old Vasanth* from Hyderabad, who blamed his family for forcing him to marry, was among those who had not disclosed their orientation to their wives. \"If I tell my wife about my relationship with men, she may harm herself. What will happen if she tells our families? I may be making a mistake, but I cannot trouble her. So my relationship remains a secret,\" he said. The study pointed to the high-risk sexual behaviour among MSM and a higher prevalence of HIV among married MSM than unmarried ones. The pressure on them to conform to heteronormative masculine norms leads to hurried and unsafe sex with multiple partners. Many MSMs are also victims of blackmail. \"Their male partners threaten to expose them to their wives if they don\u2019t listen to their demands. In the process, they end up having sex without protection,\" said Jaya, general manager of Sahodaran, which operates a helpline for the LGBT community in Chennai. Some of the couples surveyed for the study had separated after the women got to know about their husbands\u2019 sexual preferences, while some remained married but no longer had a sex. However, a majority of participants continued to have sex both with their wives and partners. A few of them said they encouraged their wives to have extramarital relationships as they were not attracted to them. Women said they remain in these marriages due to cultural and economic pressures, and some for their children. Some women, described pressure from their husbands to have anal sex against their wishes. \"Accounts from both husbands and wives in our study indicate that husbands are the primary sexual decision-makers; some men clearly consider it a right. The men interviewed said they did not feel that using condom with their wives was \"necessary\", even when they had unsafe sex with other partners. \u2018I have a medical check-up every three months, so what is the need to use condom with my wife?\u2019 asked a 27-year-old bisexual man in Madurai. Condoms were only seen as a birth control measure and not to prevent sexually transmitted diseases,\" said Solomon. \"But, several participants we interviewed were actively seeking a pregnancy at the time of the interview, and consequently avoided using condoms with their wives,\" he added. The study said there is an urgent need for interventions to address HIV-related risk posed to wives without the unwanted disclosure of husbands\u2019 same-sex behaviour. \"For instance, engagement of these husbands in pre-exposure prophylaxis (taking HIV medicines daily to lower chances of getting infected) could reduce the men\u2019s own risk of HIV, and thereby also reduce the risk of onward transmission to their wives.\" Researchers also suggested forming more support groups for these women.

HIV and viral hepatitis are among the biggest public health threats in India today as they can produce many genotypes (genetic constitution of an individual organism), which keep combining to form recombinant strains or mutations making detection trickier. Understanding the distribution of genotypes and recombinants is critical to development of diagnostic tests. India has the third largest HIV incidence in the world -- more than 2.1 million people.

A division bench of the HC headed by Justice Surya Kant has issued the notice after taking cognizance of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Karanveer Thamman of Banur in Rajpura tehsil of Patiala district. Referring to some media reports, the petitioner has stated in the PIL that at least 1,630 inmates in nine central jails in Punjab have tested positive for HIV. Modern Jail, Fridkot, has the highest number of 439 HIV positive inmates, while Bathinda has 30, Ferozepur 322, Amritsar 299, Kapurthala 210, Ludhiana 137, Patiala 75, Hoshiarpur 63 and Gurdaspur 55. According to the petitioner, spread of HIV positive disease among jail inmates is caused due to sharing of syringes (used for taking drugs) and through sexual contact. The jail authorities avoid their responsibility by contending that medical examination of persons is not done before lodging them into Jails. Thus, the high incidence of HIV positive cases amongst jail inmates is taking place with connivance of jail officials, and an independent probe should be conducted by a high powered team of retired and honest police officers, advocates and retired judges, the petitioner argued. He added that such team would bring out the true reasons for spread of HIV positive cases among jail inmates. It was further argued that the measures suggested by such a team will go a long way in preventing HIV positive from spreading its wings in jails. The counsel also pleaded that conducting of medical examination and maintaining of records of such medical examination of persons before lodging them into jail, would prevent spread of this dreadful disease further, and conducting of periodical examination of jail inmates would help fixing responsibility of jail officials, if such a person (who did not test positive for HIV) is later found to be inflicted with the virus.

A study conducted by the society has found that the Elisa test was more effective than nucleic test. HIV screening had become a matter of concern following the detection of the virus in a kid, who underwent blood transfusion at Regional Cancer Centre. Now, National AIDS Control Organisation has informed that it would supply Elisa test kits to the state. \"For the time being, we have supplied enough kits to all government medical college hospitals and Regional Cancer Centre. Moreover, Kerala State Medical Services Corporation (KMSCL) has also been asked to procure the kits, which will be supplied to all the blood banks and hospitals with blood banks,'' said Dr R Ramesh, managing director of KSACS. As per the study, in the nucleic test the virus could not be detected even for a week after the blood is collected. \"But Elisa test gives more accurate result even during the first one week window period,'' said Dr Ramesh. In the past one year, KSACS collected 4 lakh blood units, of which 300 were detected with HIV using the third generation Elisa test. \"In the past four years, we might have collected about 25 lakh blood units and only in one case it has gone undetected (in the RCC incident). Hence our testing facilities are accurate. With this 4th generation test, we can assure 100% safety and accuracy,'' he pointed out. Now, KSACS has decided to go for a wide-spread campaign for voluntary blood donation since it is the only safe way for collecting the blood units. \"We have achieved only 60% in voluntary blood donation and the remaining is still replacement blood donation. The latter is always risky,'' he said. Catch 25, a campaign to encourage youths in the age group 18 to 25 for voluntary blood donation will be launched by KSACS. \"We have found that most of high-risk groups are above 30 years and hence it would be safe if we could promote voluntary blood donation among youngsters below 25 years,'' said Dr Ramesh."}

It will measure the quantity of HIV virus in patients and help doctors decide their treatment regime. Hitherto, the test was conducted only after the first line of drugs failed, which would happen after 5-7 years of patients being diagnosed with HIV, and result in them losing golden time in starting new medicines. On Saturday, Naco instructed all state governments to get patients to undergo routine viral load tests and check mortality rate. A staggering 80,173 people have died of HIV over the past decade in Karnataka, according to the death audit conducted by Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS). A total of 3.1 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) have registered for ART in the state. Across the country, an estimated 21 lakh HIV positive patients are registered with 525 ART centres. Bengaluru has seven such centres. While 3,16,252 people living with HIV have registered for ART treatment in Karnataka as on December 2017, only 1, 65,917 of them actively turn up for follow-ups. The rest are either dead or don\u2019t visit the centres. The practice till date was to get a patient, whose blood tests positive for HIV, to undergo a CD4 count before starting anti-retro viral drugs. CD4 count is a prognostic indicator where a higher number indicates a stronger immune system. Henceforth, the patient will have to undergo a viral load test too while registering for ART treatment. \u201cThe cost of viral load test in the private sector ranges from Rs 4,000-6,000 and not all can afford it. The government will be spending Rs 1,200 per test,\u201d said an officer from KSAPS. This Naco move will be implemented from February 8 through M/s Metropolis Healthcare Limited under a public-private partnership (PPP) project. In the first year, the agency will conduct 2.1 lakh tests. The remaining patients will be covered in a phased manner. \u201cCurrently, the programme was using targeted viral load testing to confirm suspected treatment failure owing to clinical or immunological failure of the patient. From now on, patients on ART will be monitored via viral load test at regular intervals. The result will allow early detection of potential treatment failure,\u201d a senior officer in KSAPS said. Naco had also set a timeline to be followed while conducting viral load testing. \u201cFor patients on the first line of treatment, the test should be done twice in the first year, once every six months. From the second year onwards, it should happen once a year. For second/third line patients, it must be conducted once every six months after the patient\u2019s initiation on ART,\u201d said KSAPS officers. However, NGOs closely working with people living with HIV (PHIV) in creating awareness have questioned the government\u2019s partnership with a private entity. \u201cThere is a HIV law in place and the rules are likely to be framed by April 2018. Even before formulating the rules, why has the government tied up with a private party? Besides, if the private agency conducts tests only on 2.1 lakh of the total 21 lakh people registered for ART treatment in the country, it will cover only 10%. What about the rest? Instead, viral load tests should have been mandated for all HIV patients once every six months,\u201d said David Bodapatti, who has been working with PLHIV.

Deep Chand (name changed), sobbing inconsolably, is an embodiment of that mortifying scare. In the past three months, 38 people from this locality of Bangarmau tehsil have been found HIV positive at screening camps in the past three months. The needle of suspicion is pointed towards a quack, Rajendra Yadav, who has been held. Till a few months ago, Deep Chand was just like most men from Prem Ganj, working as a 'palledar' (loader) at the nearby grain market. But a few months ago, his body started saying 'no' to humongous sacks he would carry on his back to make a living. Continuous excruciating pain in the lower back took him to Yadav's Station Road clinic in Bangarmau, the destination for many in his neighbourhood needing cheap medical help. But relief eluded him. Last month, at a camp in Prem Ganj to screen HIV cases he, along with his wife and son, tested positive. Now, he has to report to Kanpur ART Centre, 50 km away, for regular check-up and medication which is free. He also has four daughters. But fearing worst, he has not made them undergo the test. \"I am not fit and don't earn like before. What will happen if they, too, are tested positive? Medicine is free, but I don't have money to take six people to Kanpur. I can't even afford the cost of copies and pencils,\" he vents his angst. Two other nearby villages under the virus onslaught are Chakmeera and Kidmiyapur. Among the victims is a 70-year-old and also six-year-old girl. Her parents, however, are not infected. This has flummoxed local health officials. Rajendra Yadav, who would run his clinic from the corridor of an old Sanskrit school on the Station Road and is said to have infected many from the locality with infected syringes, was Dr 'Fixit' for the people. As per Deepu, a local youth, patients would make a beeline before his clinic before he would open it at 9am. Till the time he would call it a day around 11pm, he would have seen more than 150 patients. \"People from adjoining areas would also throng his dispensary. He used to charge Rs 10 for three doses of medicine and an injection shot. He would carry a 'jhola' in which he usually kept his medical kit, including used syringes, which he would wash from the hand-pump water,\" Deepu says. Prem Ganj came under the radar of health officials in November last when 13 people from the locality tested HIV positive at a camp held by UP State Aids Control Society. At three repeat camps in the last week of January, 25 more cases popped up. \u201cNearly 270 people from Prem Ganj had got themselves examined at the camps out of which 25 tested positive. Now, people are scared and are not willing to get themselves tested,\u201d says Sunil Kumar, a local municipal corporator."}

State health department officials said 72 people had contracted the virus in 2017, while 100 were afflicted with it in 2016 through reuse and exposure to contaminated syringes, blood transfusion and exposure to blood products. An official, however, privately admitted that the figures could be much more as several patients remain unaccounted due to poor screening methods as well as HIV infection through dialysis, which is not taken into account in state figures. \u201cPatients, who undergo haemo dialysis, are highly vulnerable to hepatitis C, B and HIV, if adequate aseptic measures are not in place during dialysis. There is a high percentage of patients battling these deadly infections in the city,\u201d pointed out Mujtaba Hasan Askari, president Helping Hand Foundation, an NGO which works with HIV patients. Recently, over 50 people were found to be infected with HIV in Unnao in Uttar Pradesh due to use of unsafe medical devices. Experts say mushrooming of blood banks, improper screening of blood and lack of checks were to be blamed for the spread of HIV. \u201cThe Telangana State Aids Control Society (TSACS) data may not reflect the true picture of new cases being infected through syringes and blood transfusion. Also, the fact that blood transfusion standards are not maintained as many private blood banks have mushroomed. Absence of checks, regulations and safety protocols make matters worse,\u201d Askari pointed out. Interestingly, the latest and most-updated technology available to detect HIV, nucleic acid test (NAT), is not available in majority of the blood banks in the state. Currently, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test as well as manual screening is carried out in majority of blood banks in the state, but these test have their limitations. \u201cFor ELISA test to detect HIV, the virus should have been active for at least 40 days before the test. Also, the manual testing method (for ELISA third generation) has the possibility of the virus not getting detected at all due to human error. Though NAT is the safest (can detect the virus if it has been in the body for seven days), it is a costly affair,\u201d T Vishnu Vardhan, chief executive officer, NTR Trust Blood Bank, said. Of 136 blood banks in the city, 43 facilities, including state-run blood banks, were being supported by National Aids Control Organization (NACO). And, less than five actually conduct NAT. NACO currently supplies the third generation manual ELISA kit to supported blood banks. \u201cThe ELISA test is followed by almost all government as well as private sector blood banks. While one possibility is that the basic antibody test that we are doing does not detect HIV as the antibody has not yet been developed, the possibility of erroneous blood banks, negligence and a small possibility of re-use of syringes cannot be ruled out,\u201d Dr V Rajasekhar, project director, TSACS, said. \u201cSo far, no incident of blood banks totally avoiding blood screening has come to our notice,\u201d he added. Also, once blood banks discover that a patient was HIV positive, they should inform, counsel and inform the TSACS and send the patient to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) in the district. \u201cUsually, the blood banks do not take it to the logical end when they find a patient is positive, they tend to wash their hands off,\u201d say insiders."}

Patients in Maharashtra too have, over the years, claimed to have contracted HIV through infected needles or syringes. An RTI response from National Aids Control Society (NACO) showed that over 500 people in the state have got HIV through infected needles. Between 2012-13 and 2016-17, 512 disclosed at Integrated Centres for Testing and Counselling (ICTCs) that exposure to infected needle was responsible for the infection, said RTI activist Chetan Kothari. Numbers suggest an average 70-200 people get HIV through infected needles every year. In 2017-18, 69 people, including 29 women, contracted the infection. But the numbers have been highly debated by state agencies working towards controlling the disease. Parimal Sinh, who heads the state Aids control society, said less than 0.5% of new infections are due to infected needles. Over 90% of the infection in the state happens through the heterosexual route. \u201cMore importantly, the needle-infection numbers are based on voluntary disclosures made by people during counselling sessions before and after they are tested for HIV in ICTCs. Often, patients tend to suggest blood transfusion and infection through needles as possible mode of transmission. While our counsellors try to find out the exact reason, we also have to keep in mind the mental state of the patient.\u201d Medically too, a single needle usage may not necessarily mean transmission of HIV. Eldred Tellis of Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, that has been working with intravenous drug users (IDUs), said the virus could survive for three hours in the bore of a needle as there is vacuum, but otherwise it would die within 10 seconds. \u201cBut since HIV is a weak virus, the viral load of the infected person has to be really high for transmission. Studies suggest that one in 10 persons will get HIV if the needle is infected.\u201d Interestingly, the highest HIV prevalence (7%) in the country is among IDUs, who use addictive substances through injections by exchanging needles. \u201cIn most cases, they pull out blood and put it back in the syringe to extract maximum of the drug and inject into veins contributing to high HIV infection,\u201d he said. Tellis added that the authorities must also think of hepatitis C infection as that transmits more efficiently than HIV. \u201cIn Mumbai IDUs, hepatitis prevalence is around 35%, whereas HIV is 9.5%,\u201d he said."}

At present, patients are being treated at the ART centre of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) medical college in Kanpur. ART is a therapy that improves the life quality of HIV patients with treatment that maximally suppresses the HIV virus. \u201cMy 10-year-old daughter is HIV positive,\u201d said Vinay (name changed), describing how his entire family makes a three-hour-long journey from Premganj where they live to the medical college in Kanpur every month. \u201cMy daughter depends on antiretroviral therapy given at the ART centre to keep living. We can\u2019t afford the fare any longer. It would be better if the authorities establish a link centre at Bangarmau CHC itself,\u201d said Vinay. His views were echoed by Sudarshan (name changed), a truck driver and a father of a 12-year-old HIV positive son. Residents of Chakmir, Sudarshan and his wife travel to Kanpur every month for treatment of their son and the bus ride costs Rs 800 per trip. \u201cThe amount spent on travelling to the nearest ART centre should be reimbursed. Moreover, the government should set up a link centre here, else I would have no option but to skip treatment,\u201d he said. Local social activists said what is worrying is that of the total 58 HIV positive cases identified so far during screening in the three villages, only 25 have visited the ART centre. \u201cART treatment can\u2019t cure HIV/AIDS. There is still no outright cure for the disease, and it does not go away by itself. But ARTs do slow down the damage that the virus does to the immune system, and allow people to live long, productive lives like everyone else, without succumbing to the disease,\u201d said an activist. A senior health official at ART centre, meanwhile, said there were several reasons why patients avoid medication. \u201cThey usually do not want to reveal their condition to their near and dear ones. Many skip the treatment out of the fear that others will find out about their condition,\u201d he said. At least 58 persons tested positive for HIV in Bangarmau after a quack allegedly used infected syringes to treat scores of his patients. Of these, 33 were detected at a blood donation camp on February 3 while 25 had come to light last year."}

In 2016, NACO, following a decline in HIV prevalence in Ahmedabad and Chennai, wrote to the state AIDS control societies in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu asking them to merge the city-specific operations with the state. A senior official in TANSACS said of the Rs 69 crore the state receives every year from NACO, at least Rs 6.9 crore goes for paying salaries of around 100 CAPACS staff. \u201cThe department is cash-strapped right now with NACO slashing funds.

Shipurkar said those cases, which have been tested positive, have to undergo further tests to get the accurate result. She added that these patients will be counselled at an integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) before starting any treatment. According to Shipurkar, Kolhapur district has 3-4 major industrial areas besides the textile business of Ichalkaranji. These industrial enterprises are major hubs of employment generation. People from at least 100km periphery migrate to Kolhapur in search of jobs, most of who are HIV positive. Another aspect unique to Kolhapur district is the seasonal migration of sugarcane cutters from Marathwada, north Maharashtra and Karnataka between October and April. DAPCU conducts regular awareness campaigns and screenings to find out prevalence of sexually-transmitted diseases among the sugarcane cutters, she said. At least one lakh people, mostly men, migrate to Kolhapur during the sugarcane cutting season. Previous reports have pointed out that unconventional working hours, heavy load, liquor consumption and unprotected sexual activity among a host of other factors others make them vulnerable to HIV. Shipurkar further said during Gam Samvedana, it has been found that people who travel to metro cities in search of work, contracted the virus there. She added all HIV positive patients should opt for Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) which they can avail at the four hospitals in the district. Patients are counselled at ICTCs before being administered treatment. After a range of blood tests, the patient whose CD4 count is less than 500, he has to take treatment throughout his life. However, the norm has been relaxed now. The CD4 count is an indicator of how well the body's immune system is working. She added that it is a growing concern that the disease is more prevalent in the remote areas of the district. Awareness campaigns will be increased in the coming days."}

The socio-economic review reveals that as compared to 2016-17, the number has gone up in 2017-18. Among the 2.90 lakh in the high-risk population covered till August 2017, 23,697 men reported having sex with males. Only 22,733 reported having sex with female sex workers. Among the 6.44 lakh in the high-risk population covered in 2016-17, 22,872 had had sex with men and 21,670 with female sex workers. Further, 917 injecting drug users (IDU) were documented in the 2016-17 survey in the high-risk population; the number increased to 1,025 till August 2017. Of the 6.44 lakh, 1.78 lakh were migrants and 4.19 lakh were truckers. The socio-economic review of the state\u2019s agriculture economy indicates a shift towards high-value crops such as cotton, groundnut, fruits and vegetables.

But in Prem Ganj, one of the three pockets of Bangarmau town of Unnao district which hogged limelight after detection of alarming number of HIV positive cases, there is something more important than checking for the compatibility of one's horoscope or 'kundali'. \"People, who are coming here with marriage proposals have started insisting to get a `No HIV' certificate from locals. Most of the locals however have accepted their demand and went for HIV test to avoid hurdles in future,\" confirmed Sunil Kumar, a local corporator. The unusual condition came under spotlight when at least 58 persons were tested HIV positive in three localities of Bangarmau town, including Prem Ganj, Chakmir and Kirmidiyapur, after a quack had allegedly used infected syringes to treat scores of his patients. Muneeshwar (name changed), a private worker, who hails from Prem Ganj pocket, chose a girl from Tirwa area of Kannauj district. Their marriage is slated to take place soon after the Holi festival. On Monday last, parents of the girl told the boy's parents that they had to abide by certain conditions prior to the wedding. The boy's side agreed and Muneeshwar underwent the necessary medical tests at the private hospital on Friday. \"On Saturday, after getting the test report, Muneeshwar and his family members heaved a sigh of relief as he had tested negative for HIV,\" informed a relative of Muneeshwar, who had played a role of mediator while talking to TOI and added that the doctor's report confirmed that he was not an HIV carrier. When the parents and siblings of the bride were informed about the report, they too were elated and gave their final consent asking the boy's family to come with `baraat' on March 4. This unusual demand might upset some people in our traditional society who may even call of a marriage, but both the sides are praiseworthy, said Dr IS Gilada, President, AIDS Society of India."}

Most of the affected inmates are undertrials, the jail administration sources said. The cases were discovered during regular health camps held at the jail over the past several months. Screening was conducted under the supervision of the UP State AIDS Control Society (UPSACS), said Gorakhpur jail superintendent Ramdhani Mishra. \u201cHealth camps to examine the health of prisoners are organised from time to time, During the past several months, 23 inmates, including a woman, have tested HIV-positive,\u201d he said.

But their HIV-positive status has turned them into social pariahs, with the city offering them no space to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams. Out to open their own caf\u00e9 called \u201cCafe Positive\u201d, all they have met with for the last three months is a big negative. No house-owner in some of south Kolkata\u2019s posh localities has been willing to rent out space once told about \u201cwho will manage and run the shop\u201d. While a few landlords have straightaway refused saying \u201ce paray erom cholbena (such business won\u2019t run in this neighbourhood)\u201d, others have been courteous enough with financial help and old clothes, but pleaded helplessness in renting out space to the 18-plus teens. The NGO funding the caf\u00e9 and trying to find a 750sqft space has approached over a dozen owners since December at locations like Golpark, Dover Lane, Lake Road, Hindustan Park and Purna Das Road. \u201cWe have been looking for a suitable space for the caf\u00e9 since December and approached a number of house-owners directly and through brokers. The owners initially seemed excited at the concept, but the moment they learnt that the shop will be managed and run solely by HIV-positive children, they backed out,\u201d said Kallol Ghosh, founder of Anandaghar, a shelter for abandoned HIV/AIDS-infected children. TOI spoke to two house-owners, one at Lake Road and the other at Dover Lane. \u201cI would not mind renting out space to them. But we live in a joint family and some members have objections. I could not convince them, so I rejected the offer,\u201d said a landlady. The house-owner at Dover Lane, too, blamed her neighbours and family. \u201cI don\u2019t know how people in our neighbourhood would react to it. I know there are many misconceptions associated with HIV. I don\u2019t think I am in a position to convince everyone. Moreover, I have now decided to rent the space to a boutique and not an eatery,\u201d he said. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2017 defines what can count as discrimination against HIV-positive people. It lists that denial or discontinuation of employment, education, healthcare services, renting or residing property, standing for public or private office will count as discrimination along with unfair treatment in any of the above mentioned categories. The shelter at Narendrapur is home to around 70-odd young patients and this caf\u00e9 project is part of an initiative to make a group self-sufficient. The NGO will give the initial funds and later hand over the management of the caf\u00e9 to the 10 boys and girls, who would be running it. \u201cWe have been undergoing training at this shelter and can\u2019t wait to start our caf\u00e9. We know the disease we suffer from and how it spreads or what precautions we need to take. But strangely, the adults don\u2019t understand that HIV doesn\u2019t spread through touch and often hesitate to even shake hands with us,\u201d said Susanta Pal (name changed), a Class XII student who was diagnosed with HIV when he was just 5. \u201cHIV does not spread by kissing, hugging, sharing food/drink, toilet seats, sweat, touching, sneeze/cough or through insect bites. We also want society to know about these from our caf\u00e9. But for that, we first need an opportunity,\u201d said Sathi Biswas (name changed), another Class XII student who specialises in sandwich-making and baking cookies. According to the plan, food and beverages at the 750sqft ground-floor caf\u00e9 will be served on disposable plates and there will be no sharp cutleries or glass items that can cause bleeding. \u201cWe are not looking for any exceptions or rebate and are ready to pay as per the existing market rate but even then not a single house-owner is ready,\u201d lamented Ghosh."}

After months of rejection, this feels like a whiff of fresh air and finally, it feels like the youths can dream big.

Another house owner has even promised us to offer the space at a discount. But we have said that we do not want any concession,\u201d said Ghosh. Another city-based doctor, Anindya Kar, has mentioned the youths as \u201cyoung warriors\u201d in a mail to the NGO and has offered them necessary donations to fund the project."}

At the age of 21 years, she and her husband had to take a tough decision to abort the child. With a mission to change peoples\u2019 perception about HIV/AIDS, she got herself involved in social activities for HIV community. At present, she is the face of HIV community in the country. Meet Daxa Patel, who is not only president of National Coalition of People Living with HIV in India (NCPI+), but also relentlessly working for patients, most of them outcast by the society. From organizing awareness camps to marriage fairs for HIV patients and successfully running a day-boarding school and hostel for HIV-infected children, Daxa has put her life, blood and sweat for their uplift. \u201cWhen my husband and I were diagnosed with HIV in 1997, there was no treatment available. Meanwhile, I got pregnant and had no choice but to go for termination. One of the doctors told me that my lifespan was just for five months. I was searching for a person infected with HIV and I found a woman who was living with the disease for two years. This gave me confidence that I could also live long. This was the turning point in my life,\u201d says 42-year-old Daxa. Daxa, who was doing a small embroidery business from her house, and her husband informed their family and relatives about the disease. To their surprise, the family was very supportive and this further boosted her confidence on fighting discrimination faced by people like her. Her treatment began only in 2007, 10 years after he was infected. It was in 2003, Daxa, who was earlier working as a counsellor with a city-based non-governmental organization SAHAS, got in touch with Umesh Patel. Along with Umesh and other few community members, they decided to launch a platform for HIV positive people. This is how the Gujarat State Network for People Living with HIV/\u00c1ID (GSNP+) was launched in 2003. The main objective of GSNP+ was to assist the people infected with HIV/AIDS, ensure they get proper medical attention and timely medicines and organizing awareness programmes etc. \u201cWe used to meet the HIV patients at some deserted places and gardens to protect their identity. We started with just 35 members at GSNP+ and now we have 67,000 members across all the districts in Gujarat,\u201d she said. Later, the NCPI+ was launched at the national level and the organization has a presence in 32 states across the country. Daxa is also running Janani Dham for the destitute HIV and AIDS infected orphaned children on the outskirts of the city since 2009. It is supported by Gujarat government\u2019s social justice department and Surat-based P P Savani Group and has around 98 boys and girls. GSNP+ will soon launch a scheme for HIV positive people, where they can get easy medicine refill and won\u2019t have to visit government dispensaries. This is for the first time that a project has been launched with the state government and will be introduced on national-level."}

While Ismail is currently undergoing treatment, not-solucky Sarita died on the road unattended near the KPHB Metro station few weeks back. The 32-year old HIV patient was staying on the road with her four children after losing her husband to AIDS five months earlier. From earning Rs 11,000 per month between themselves and being able to provide shelter, food and schooling for their children, the family fell apart completely and started living on the streets. The children were later moved to an orphanage by an NGO. In yet another case a brother wasn\u2019t allowed to keep his HIV infected sister with him in a rented flat. He was forced to leave his sister at the state run Gandhi Hospital for over a month last year. Experts say more awareness on the disease is the only solution to the stigma. Discrimination looms large despite claims of the state health department about the stigma being on the decline. Activists say it may have worsened going by number of of HIV/ AIDS patients being abandoned by family members, dumped at hospitals, shown the door at the workplace and turned out from residential societies in the city."}

The woman got married to her paternal cousin in June 2015 in the Nashik Road area. In March 2017, when she got pregnant, a private doctor informed her that she was HIV+. Subsequently, the pregnancy was terminated. After her in-laws realised that she was HIV+, they allegedly stopped her from cooking in the house, started starving her and harassed her mentally and physically while alleging that she transmitted the disease to her husband. Given the torture from her in-laws, she contacted her brother, who took her home in May 2017. While none of her in-laws came to take her back, her husband died of AIDS in January 2018. The woman was also verbally abused by her in-laws when she went to attend her husband's funeral. Feeling cheated and humiliated of being falsely accused of transmitting the disease to her husband, the woman lodged a complaint with the Kopargaon police on March 5, which was transferred to the Mumbai Naka police in Nashik city on Wednesday. Speaking to TOI, one of her relatives said that despite being closely related to the in-laws, the woman was cheated. \"Her husband was suffering from HIV for the past many years. After she was diagnosed with HIV, her husband even confided in her that it was because of him that she got the disease. He said he was not expecting the disease to be transmitted to her since he was on medication,\" said their relative. The Mumbai naka police have registered a case against four members of the woman's in-laws under sections 498 (A) (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 420 (cheating), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (Intentional insult to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code. Senior inspector Sunil Nandawalkar of the Mumbai Naka police station said, \"We are investigating the case to ascertain who was infected with HIV first.

It is under the \u2018Viral load testing for all people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV)\u2019 initiative launched by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on February 26 this year. The ART centres selected in Bihar are at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) Patna and Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), Muzaffarpur. Total 530 ART centres have been selected for free viral load testing of 12 lakh PLHIV on treatment in the country at least once a year. The central government has tied up with a private laboratory in Mumbai under public-private partnership (PPP) mode to provide viral load testing facility to patients across the country. A senior state health department official said samples would be collected from the three ART centres and flown to the Mumbai laboratory for test. \u201cA hard copy of the report will be sent to the state,\u201d he said. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) targets and destroys CD4 T cells that strengthen immunity in a person. Patients with a CD4 count below 200 are susceptible to develop serious illnesses. Viral load testing essentially tells whether the ART treatment regimen is working or not by measuring the amount of virus in a patient\u2019s blood. \u201cIn more than 95% cases, the viral load becomes undetectable after six months of ART treatment. Earlier, the only test conducted to measure the effectiveness of treatment was to check the immune level (CD4 test) in a patient. Sometimes, the patient also becomes drug-resistant after treatment and thus the viral load increases. With viral load testing in government ART centres, it will be possible to detect the increase of the viruses in the blood of the patient after treatment,\u201d a member of International AIDS Society, Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, said. There are only three private labs in Patna for collecting samples for viral load testing and they charge approximately Rs4000- 4500 for one test."}

She is Meena Vij, who lost her husband to AIDS in 2004. She was in her second pregnancy in 1994 when she learnt she was HIV +ve. She aborted the child and confronted her husband, who ran a hotel. \u201cAfter initial hesitance, he accepted his relationships with multiple partners,\u201d said Meena, whose son is 27 now, and HIV negative. There was no \u2018happily ever after\u2019 in Meena\u2019s life with her husband, but today she helps the people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Chandigarh find love. She has married off eight of them. Her face lights up at announcing that barring one, the rest of the couples are proud parents of HIV-negative children. \u201cOf the myths about the disease, one is that the babies born to a mother with HIV also test positive,\u201d Meena said. \u201cPeople are unaware that if the mother and her baby receive proper medication during pregnancy and after birth, the chances of it are very less.\u201d Network of friends Meena is a member of the Chandigarh Network of People living with HIV/AIDS, or CNP+ for short. She is also a peer counsellor of Vihaan, a CNP+ programme. Network\u2019s president Pooja Thakur was shunned by her in-laws when she tested positive along with her two sons a decade ago. Her eldest son, however, is HIV negative. Her husband died of AIDS. Pooja dared to go public about her HIV status in order to work for HIV awareness and counselling. Her positive attitude towards life rubbed on to several women and gave them the courage to live. One of them is today a member of Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society (SACS), CNP+, and Vihaan. She joined the network in 2007 after losing her husband to AIDS. She could move to Chandigarh with her four children because of a supportive brother. Created in November 2005, CNP+ meets on the 25th of every month, for tasks such as introducing new members, following up on the missed cases, and linking the members with ART centres. Today, the network has 1,000-plus registered members, who pay an annual subscription of Rs 100. CNP+ and Vihaan participate in many programmes of the state society. \u201cWe tell the PLHIV to visit the 12 integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) in Chandigarh for free testing. We ask people to practice safe sex,\u201d said Rahul, HIV+ve for more than 10 years. Discrimination Meena said: \u201cMore important than fighting the disease is to fight the social stigma that keeps people from sharing their HIV status with family and taking treatment. We share our life stories with these people to boost their morale. We are living examples that with proper medication and diet, one can live with this virus for years,\u201d said Meena, HIV +ve for 24 years. The PLHIVs live as outcasts. Family and friends discriminate against them, while even doctors judge them. Pooja asked for countrywide order for the doctors and clerks to write \u201cuniversal precaution\u201d instead of \u201cHIV positive\u201d on their hospital cards, \u201cso that the chemists don\u2019t look at us differently when they see the stamp\u201d. \u2018Admit our kids\u2019 \u201cIf our identity is revealed, our children won\u2019t get admission in schools,\u201d said a member of the network, seeking government support for a home for HIV-positive children and a higher monthly pension for widows and children from the present Rs 1,000 and Rs 700, respectively.

The girl\u2019s father said she was taken to the RCC after the doctors at the MCH diagnosed her with leukemia in February, 2017. The treatment for leukemia began on March 1, 2017. While she was under treatment at RCC the girl underwent blood transfusion several times. The girl was tested positive for HIV in August, 2017. \u201cOn October 5, our child was taken to a lab in Chennai for a detailed HIV test. However, the lab report said she was not HIV positive. The doctors at RCC said it was not a final report and they can confirm the presence of HIV only after getting a report from Delhi. But the doctors have not given that report us till date,\u201d he said. The girl\u2019s father said she was discharged from the RCC on November 1last year. \u201cAfter that she was never taken to the RCC. We followed ayurveda treatment. But it did not work her. She was under the treatment of doctors at Alappuzha MCH. On Wednesday, her condition became serious and we took her to the MCH. But she died,'' he said. The funeral will be held on Thursday. Dr Ramesh R, project director of the Kerala State AIDS Control Society (KSACS), said the blood samples of the girl were tested in the lab of General Hospital, Tambaram in Chennai but the lab could not find viral load in her blood samples. \u201cWe forwarded the report to National AIDS Control Organization (NACO). They did not advice treatment for HIV as the Chennai lab could not find viral load. We were planning to conduct a repeat HIV test on her in CMC Vellore after some months,'' he said. The Medical College police in Thiruvananthapuram in September 2017 had registered case and launched a probe after receiving a complaint from the girl's parents in this regard. The KSACS, which conducted a probe into the incident, has given a clean chit to the RCC authorities and the report of the KSACS said that the blood given to the nine-yearold girl during transfusion at RCC in Thiruvananthapuram was tested before the procedure and HIV was not detected. Report of KSACS however pointed out that RCC was not equipped to detect the virus during the window period. Read this story in Bengali"}

While the number remains a concern for officials, what is worrying them even more is that they could not establish the source of the disease in 32 children, an increase of 10. This has led officials to believe that more children are engaging in highrisk sexual behavior or are victims of abuse. In 2015, of the 311 children who tested positive for HIV/ AIDS in the state, 289 contracted the infection from their HIV-infected mothers during pregnancy, labour or breastfeeding. Officials couldn\u2019t establish the source of the infection in 22 children. Two years later, the number of parent-to-child transmission dipped along with the number of new cases detected among children, but the number of unaccounted cases touched 32, show data furnished by Tamil Nadu State Aids Control Society in response to an RTI application by TOI. Officials and doctors say they suspect the mode of transmission of the infection among these children to be sexual as the increase is corroborated by an uptick in the number of children referred to government-run clinics for sexually transmitted infections. The number went up from 6,234 in 2015 to 8,871last year. Recognising the growing prevalence of STIs among children, TANSACS project director K Senthil Raj said he is in talks with the school education secretary to dedicate more space to sex education in the soon-to-be-introduced revamped textbooks. Children could have acquired HIV through transfusion, says official He said staff at the integrated counselling and testing centers (ICTC) for HIV usually maintain a record of children with the infection, including those who haven\u2019t got it from infected mothers. \u201cThey usually don\u2019t probe. But if they do find the reason during the counselling, they maintain it in their notebooks,\u201d he said. Some of the children, he said, could have acquired it through blood transfusion or injectable drugs. Consultant psychiatrist Dr M Suresh Kumar, who has worked extensively with injection drug users, rules out this possibility. \u201cHeroin and other synthetic injectable opioids were popular till the late 90s. We haven\u2019t been seeing young heroin addicts in a while,\u201d saidDr Kumar.Hisobservation is backed by official data: Of the 1.43 lakh people living withHIVin TNcovered under the central-sponsored prevention programme, 56 are users of injectibles. All are in their 40s and above. Dr Kumar saidthey are,however, seeing other kinds of addictions, including marijuana and alcohol,on the rise among youngsters. \u201cIt is known that high drug use can make you vulnerable to engaging in high-risksexualbehavior,\u201d he noted. HIV specialist Dr S Sundar observed that the state should expand its HIV/AIDS prevention programme to youngsters who aren\u2019t part of the traditional \u201chigh-risk\u201d group. \u201cAll our programmes are targeted at the high-risk population like female sex workers, transgenders, men who have sex with men and truck drivers. But ask a counsellor at an ICTC who he or sheseesthe most\u2013itisusually people who are not part of this group,\u201d hesaid. \u201cChildren are engaging in sexual activity belowthelegal ageof consent. It is a fact. They could be in a situation where nobody will even ask for consent,\u201d added Sundar. Whatever be the source, once diagnosed, these children are forced to battle the stigma associated with the infection or live in the fear that someone may find out they are positive, said P Manorama, former chairperson of Child Welfare Committee, Chennai, who runs an organisation that works with children withHIV. Shesaidshe receives at least one child trafficking victim a year who tests positivefor HIVlinkedto sexualexploitation. \u201cButthey remain mere names in the state\u2019s medical records.

In past several years, only three to five units of HIV infected blood units had been timely detected annually. The rise implies that the number of HIV infected persons are increasing, and also that KGMU has been able to detect infected blood with much more precision by using the specialized Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT), than the previously used ELISA testing method to check donated blood for preventing infections via blood transfusion. Speaking at a programme on \u2018Safe Blood Transfusion: Need of the Hour\u2019, head of transfusion medicine department at KGMU, Prof Tulika Chandra said, \u201cBlood transfusion runs a direct risk of contracting HIV if the blood is infected. We at KGMU have undertaken NAT since 2012. Since then, of the 3,10,000 units tested by NAT, 2,300 were found to be infected with HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C and were thus discarded.\u201d Docs: NAT saved 9k lives by detecting infected blood units But, it is not just 2,300 lives, that KGMU claims to have saved, depending on just conducting NAT on blood. \u201cNAT helped save more than 9,000 lives by detecting 2,300 infected blood units that were discarded since four blood components would have been segregated from each unit, which equals to four patients and any one of this unit can be infected,\u201d said Prof Chandra. She added that the number of HIV infected blood units has grown exponentially while cases of blood infected with Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B have gone down over the years. \u201cThere is an urgent need for blood transfusions to be made safe and the government should take note of this fact. Infected blood can be fatal if transfused to an ailing person. There is a phenomena called horizontal transfusion, which means that a person, transfused with infected blood, can give the infection to others in family through sexual and sometimes other means,\u201d she added. Prof Chandra added that KGMU and SGPGIMS are the only centres using NAT while other government hospitals are still using the ELISA testing method. ELISA detects antibodies or antigens produced months after an infection is contracted and is thus futile for recent infections. NAT on the other hand, directly detects DNA or RNA of the infection causing virus present in the blood, making it more accurate."}

Researchers have found that Treg cells, a type of regulatory lymphocyte, might be protecting babies in the womb from getting infected with the HIV virus when the mother is infected. \"Finding out what protects the majority of babies is important, as it can lead to ways to boost natural immune responses and make individuals resistant to HIV infection,\" said researcher Peter Kessler from the Emory University School of Medicine. Scientists had been puzzled for years by the fact that only a minority of babies born to mothers with HIV infection get the infection from their mothers. Currently, HIV infection can be successfully managed with antiretroviral drugs, but these drugs have to be given for life. Preventing the infection is very important, but there is no vaccine available yet. Researchers found that levels of Treg lymphocytes were higher in the blood of newborn babies born to mothers with HIV infection who had escaped the infection themselves, compared with babies who were born with HIV infection. Lymphocytes are cells of the immune system that protect the body by fighting bacteria and viruses. Treg cells, or regulatory T cells, are an important \"self-check\" in the immune system to prevent excessive immune reactions that could lead to tissue damage. The researchers examined the blood of 64 babies who were born HIV-uninfected and 28 babies born HIV-infected and found that Treg cell levels were higher in uninfected babies at the time of birth. In contrast, other lymphocyte types were activated and higher in HIV-infected infants. The HIV virus can only infect cells that are activated, so Treg may protect from HIV infection by suppressing activation of other lymphocytes. They analyzed the stored blood by flow cytometry, a technique that can differentiate between the different types of cells based on what markers they express on their surface. Regulatory T cells come in many forms with the most well-understood being those that express the markers CD4, CD25, and FOXP3. \"Even though the number of babies studied is relatively small, these findings indicate that Treg, by controlling immune activation, may lower the vulnerability of the babies to HIV or other chronic infections even before they are born,\" said Kessler. These results could pave the way for the development of vaccines or other immune-based therapies that could be used together with medications to prevent the spread of HIV or other infections from mothers to their babies."}

We hope the rest of the city learns from this; these kids deserve all our support in their struggle. At 524 Jodhpur Park, a senior official of a leading national ayurvedic firm and an honorary member of Rotary Club of Calcutta has offered his garage space to the teenagers from where they plan to start the caf\u00e9 in July. \u201cI was initially a bit hesitant to offer my garage space as it is much smaller than what they were looking for.

Chief minister Vasundhara Raje had declared that 5,000 dairy booths will be opened in the state for the women out of which 1,000 will be in Jaipur city. This will be done to empower women and to raise employment opportunities for them. Along with this, there are even plans to open a single window for licensing in the JMC office as the complaints of the public towards the authorities related to the issue of licensing for dairy booths are rising in number. This plan is made to keep a check on the officials so that problem will not be created for the general public. Jaipur city is divided into eight zones and at present in every zone a junior engineer (JEN) look after the matter but after the implementation of single window, soon two JEN and two clerks will look after the matters of four zones each in the office to be allotted in the JMC. Mayor Ashok Lahoti said, \u201cThe decision to open a single window is taken to make the licensing scheme more transparent. There is a plan to open 1,000 new dairy booths in the city and new licenses will be given only to the ladies as per the social welfare scheme announced by the chief minister Vasundhara Raje. In all the 91 wards, we have planned to give one dairy booth to the women suffering from AIDS, cancer or is a widow, to help them earn a decent living.\u201d To increase the competition in the state regarding the milk sale JMC has even planned to give 100 booths to the Amul dairy which will also be the company\u2019s first entry in Rajasthan.

Since little over a month, 16 children aged between six months and two years are being given pellets, which look like homeopathy pills, containing drugs lopinavir and ritonavir. The pellets, that can be sprinkled over food too, have already proven to be advantageous, in terms of administration. The syrup, which used to be the main alternative for paediatric patients, was met with a lot of resistance as it left a bitter aftertaste and children would often spit it out. The centre at Sion hospital will be documenting the efficacy and acceptance of the oral pellets, along with the other centres. \u201cSo far, the response has been positive. Earlier, parents would return with the syrup bottles and say it was unpalatable,\u201d said Dr Yashwant Gabhale, head of the paediatric centre at Sion. Additionally, a decrease in side-effects has also been seen. \u201cProblems such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been minimal, so far,\u201d he added. There are nearly 76,000 children living with HIV in the country of which 5,000-odd are from Maharashtra. The use of oral pellets has been restricted to children up to two years of age for now. While the national programme incorporated children since 2006, it was only by late 2007 that paediatric formulations were available. Former paediatric head of Sion hospital Dr Mamata Manglani said that children were initially given adult medication till syrups came into the national programme. \u201cHowever, there were logistical and storage issues with syrups that paved the way for dispensable tablets over time,\u201d she said. Finding pharmaceutical companies to make child-friendly formulations has always been a challenge, say NACO experts, who hope to scale up once the paediatric centres present their feedback and there are more suppliers. \u201cCurrently, Cipla is the only company that is making oral pellet formulation. Mylan is likely to start producing it next,\u201d said NACO\u2019s Dr RS Gupta. He said the introduction of pellets is likely to make a big difference in adherence. \u201cGulping pills every day is a struggle in itself. It becomes more difficult for babies,\u201d he said. Doctors say the overall adherence among children is more than 90%, till their parents are giving them the medicines. A parent TOI spoke to said oral pellets are undoubtedly easy to administer. \u201cWe only hope that it is regularly available and the supply is uninterrupted since there are limited manufacturers,\u201d he said. Not too long ago, the syrup was in short supply across the country."}

The Joint UN Agency on AIDS (UNAIDS) report titled 'Miles to go -- closing gaps, breaking barriers, righting injustices' said Asia and the Pacific regions have made strong inroads with its HIV response. Sustained and focused efforts to reach key populations have led to major reductions in HIV infections in Cambodia, India, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam between 2010 and 2017. The report, however, warned that the global new HIV infections were not declining fast enough. It also noted that the epidemics were expanding in Pakistan and the Philippines. In India, new HIV infections dropped from 120,000 in 2010 to 88,000 in 2017, AIDS-related deaths from 160,000 to 69,000 and people living with HIV from 2,300,000 to 2,100,000 in the same time period, the report said. India has an approved social protection strategy, policy or framework that is being implemented, it said. Successive surveys in Cambodia, India, Thailand and Vietnam also indicate that attitudes towards people living with HIV have improved creating safer working conditions for sex workers and engaging them closely in the design and implementation of programmes make a huge difference, it said. The report underscored the public health benefits of decriminalising sex work. It found that countries that had decriminalised at least some aspects of sex work have fewer sex workers living with HIV than countries that criminalise all aspects of sex work. Modelling based on data from Canada, India and Kenya indicates that the decriminalisation of sex work could avert 33-46 per cent of HIV infections over the course of a decade. The report cited the example of Karnataka, where advocacy work with senior police officials, sensitisation workshops and the inclusion of HIV and human rights topics in pre-service curricula led to significant decreases in the arrest of female sex workers, especially during police raids. Before the interventions, half (50 per cent) of the 4,110 surveyed female sex workers said they had been arrested or detained at some point during police raids, that proportion shrank to 20 per cent after the interventions, the report said. Referring to the initiative sponsored by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to reduce the spread of HIV in India, the report said the Avahan programme in Karnataka and other States remained a \"sterling example\" of the impact of combining condom programming with community empowerment and structural improvements that tackle stigma, violence and unsafe working environments. UNAIDS, however, issued a stark wake-up call for nations, warning that the global response to HIV is at a precarious point. At the halfway point to the 2020 targets, the report warned that the pace of progress was not matching global ambition. \"We are sounding the alarm\", said Michel Sidibe, Executive Director of UNAIDS. \"Entire regions are falling behind, the huge gains we made for children are not being sustained, women are still most affected, resources are still not matching political commitments and key populations continue to be ignored. All these elements are halting progress and urgently need to be addressed head-on,\" Sidibe said. Global new HIV infections have declined by just 18 per cent in the past seven years, from 2.2 million in 2010 to 1.8 million in 2017, the report noted. Although this is nearly half the number of new infections compared to the peak in 1996 (3.4 million), the decline is not quick enough to reach the target of fewer than 500,000 by 2020. In 2017, an estimated 36.9 million people globally were living with HIV and 21.7 million people were accessing treatment, it said. The report also shows that key populations are not being considered enough in HIV programming. Key populations and their sexual partners account for 47 per cent of the new HIV infections worldwide and 97 per cent of new HIV infections in eastern Europe and central Asia, where one third of new HIV infections are among people who inject drugs. \"The right to health for all is non-negotiable,\" said Sidibe. \"Sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, prisoners, migrants, refugees and transgender people are more affected by HIV but are still being left out from HIV programmes. More investments are needed in reaching these key populations,\" Sidibe added."}

She, however, didn\u2019t become a victim of HIV. Fighting stigma, she groomed her self-confidence and started saving for her sons\u2019 education. Today, her elder son, an MTech holder, works in Hyderabad, while her younger son is pursuing undergraduate engineering. Like Aishwarya, thousands of sex workers and sexual minorities have successfully kept HIV at bay and changed their lives drastically, thanks to project Avahan. The initiative focuses on integrating biological and behavioural aspects of target groups and empowering them with peer education. Avahan has been described as a \u201csterling example\u201d in the recent report released by the joint UN Agency on AIDS (UNAIDS). Between 2003-12, the project, funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and University of Manitoba in Canada, reached out to 65,000 sex workers and over 25,000 sexual minorities. As per a survey, the findings of which were reported in British Medical Journal, the prevalence of HIV in Karnataka reduced from 19.6% to 10.8% and of syphilis (another sexually transmitted disease) from 5.9% to 2.4%, with the increased use of condoms. Avahan, which targeted 16 districts of Karnataka, was credited for the achievement. \u201cWe got an identity. We ensured that we protected ourselves even while in the job. I am now into counselling and am leading a better life. I was able to save money for my children\u2019s education,\u201d said Aishwarya, who is no longer in sex work. What made Avahan a successful model was that it never took a moral and judgemental view, says H L Mohan, managing trustee, Karnataka Health Promotion Trust (KHPT), who spearheaded the project. According to a Lancet report, Avahan prevented no less than six lakh HIV cases in India. Karnataka was one of the six states chosen for the project, and here, it was executed by KHPT from 2003 to 2012. The programme not only brought in mandatory condom usage but also worked for the community members\u2019 empowerment. Clinics were set up where members went for fortnightly tests. The project also helped them save money in cooperative societies run by themselves. Drop-in centres were established at the hotspots, where sex workers could walk in at any time to relax, watch TV and consult doctors. In Bengaluru, the centres were set up in Yeshwantpur, Shivajinagar and Malleswaram and were functional 24/7. With every fortnightly visit, members of the vulnerable section understood the complexity of the situation they were in. \u201cWe set up cooperative societies run by sex workers, so that they can save money and don\u2019t have to borrow from money lenders. We have even saved many young girls from being trafficked,\u201d said Mohan. In 2013, when the project ended, the centres were subsumed with the government. \u201cAvahan should have been an ongoing project to make the state HIV-free,\u201d added Mohan. Even now, KHPT gets visitors from abroad who come to study the model that led to HIV prevention. No mean feat To win the confidence of sex workers and work with them in risk-reduction interventions wasn\u2019t easy to begin with. Usage of condoms alone wouldn\u2019t have worked unless we reduced their vulnerability. We had to closely work with them to understand the strategy to safeguard them from infections. We did a hotspot mapping involving them. The strategy was different for each district. While home-based prostitution was seen more in districts like Shivamogga, street-based work was more prevalent in places like Davanagere, Ballari and Bengaluru H L Mohan, managing trustee, KHPT"}

The board invited curious stares and subjected the family to humiliating questions. No sooner they found out about the board, the patient\u2019s children decided not to dare enter the ward for fear of being discriminated at the educational institutions where they study. Other members of the family were in tears trying to fend off unwanted questions. TimesViewDiscriminating against and victimising an HIV/AIDS patient is not only condemnable, it is also criminal. This single insensitive act by the state\u2019s premier hospital will only serve to dissuade others from seeking treatment. Under the central law that provides for stiff punishment against all actions that may lead to hostility against HIV patients, both, the person who ordered the placing of the board on the patient\u2019s bed and implementor, must be punished. Also, the state government must immediately see to it that all staffers of GMC, medical and otherwise, are apprised about the proper ethics to be followed in treating HIV patients and the consequences in case of failure to do so. \u201cThe doctors, nurses, attendants and even those who bring food and clean the patient know about the health status. It is clearly written in all the papers appended in the treatment file too. I can\u2019t understand why this board was put,\u201d a close relative of the patient said. \u201cThe hospital should be helping such people who may not live for long. If they did not want us here, then they should have given us a special room or sent us away,\u201d she said. The patient has been admitted at GMC in the past but this is the first time the family says such a board was affixed. \u201cThe staff did not think about the repercussions on the family. The ward sister was actually fixing the board near the patient\u2019s head, but later put it at the foot of the bed. Were instructions given by the doctor to put the board? When the other patients ask the nurses about the board, won\u2019t they reveal the health status?\u201d she asked. \u201cEven the few people who are coming to visit the patient will stop once they come to know about the health status. Neighbours are also coming to visit and are asking about the board. It\u2019s a big shame for us. I\u2019m going mad,\u201d she said. The board was removed on Tuesday evening after a non-governmental organisation, Human Touch, working to end discrimination and provide care and support to people living with HIV raised the issue with the hospital authorities. Dean of Goa Medical College Dr Pradeep Naik said circulars were issued in the past asking the staff members to avoid any such terminology. \u201cWe have given strict instructions to all wards not to engage in any discriminatory behaviour against patients. From the preliminary report which I have received, it is not clear who put up the board. I have sought a detailed report by Wednesday. We will repeat the circular that we had issued earlier. This will never happen again,\u201d he told TOI. \u201cUniversal precautions are necessary, but should not be displayed publicly on the patient\u2019s bed,\u201d CEO of Human Touch Foundation Peter Borges said. \u201cThis is not an isolated case. Such incidents will lead to more stigma and discrimination for those living with HIV. Such attitude of those working in medical space is unbecoming and will create hardships for those trying to access healthcare services in public hospitals. We will never be able to end the stigma if it exists in medical settings,\u201d Borges said."}

The only difference is in the current case, the patient wasn\u2019t incarcerated. The HIV and AIDS Prevention Act, 2017 should be applied and an FIR must be filed,\u201d he told TOI, referring to the incident of discrimination at GMC on Tuesday. Dominic tested positive in 1989 and was detained in isolation at Mapusa TB Sanatorium. His friends approached Gilada who came down to Goa from Mumbai. He organized rallies in Dominic\u2019s village in Parra and filed a writ petition through his mother, a retired nurse, to challenge the detention under provisions of Goa Public Health (Amendment) Act. He met legislators and was asked to give a presentation in the assembly to bring some clarity about the virus and its effects. \u201cThen speaker Dayanand Narvekar invited me to give a presentation at the assembly.

I also urged them to repeal the Goa Public Health Amendment Act, which they later did,\u201d he also said. The legislation made it mandatory to keep HIV-infected persons in isolation. He got Mumbai-based lawyer Anand Grover to fight the case in the high court and after 64 days of forced isolation, Dominic was released. \u201cThe case paved the way for a sustained fight against discrimination and human rights violations of patients and culminated into the passage of the recent HIV Aids Act,\u201d says Gilada."}

The HIV-positive girl is hearing impaired and her mental ability is that of a child half her age. Like her, at least 60% of the 110 inmates at Solapur\u2019s Palawi-Prabha Hira Pratishthan, the state\u2019s oldest institution caring for children with HIV, suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss. TOI found that the prevalence of height and weight stunting is more than 70%, while over 30% have stymied mental development. AIDS-related deaths may have dropped by 54% in India over a decade, but most children in rural areas living on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are barely surviving, afflicted by physical and mental deficiencies. The reason: the national programme focuses on medicines instead of a comprehensive medical, nutritional and psychosocial model. For the nearly three lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors, mostly underpaid, and overburdened with administrative work. A fourth of India\u2019s 60,000-odd children taking ART for HIV live in Maharashtra. With no adequate support, the state recently learned that over 30,000 of the two lakh patients on treatment have quietly dropped out. Stunted, depressed, low on hearing: HIV+ kids face fallout despite drugs Sumana looks like a 10-year-old though she\u2019s a teenager 11 months shy of 18. Four feet tall and with body weight of 30kg, she is at least 25kg underweight and significantly short for her age. Her mental ability is of a child half her age and she is hearing impaired. At Solapur\u2019s Palawi-Prabha Hira Pratishthan, one of Maharashtra\u2019s oldest institutions caring for children living with HIV, cases like Sumana\u2019s are not an exception. At least 60% of the 110 children here suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss. The prevalence of height and weight stunting is more than 70%, while over a third have stymied mental development. Besides physical, prevalence of mental health problems such as depression is alarmingly high. AIDS-related deaths have dropped by 54% and new infections by 66% in India over a decade, but children like Sumana are a testimony to the gaping deficit in the national programme that focuses on drugs instead of a holistic medical, nutritional and psychosocial model that a complex disease such as HIV warrants. A little over a quarter of the 60,000 such children are in Maharashtra. An otherwise spirited child, Sumant gets drowsy and irritable after taking medicines. \u201cI get severe stomach-ache, dizziness, headache and diarrhoea,'' he says, describing his plight after taking the daily dose of antiretroviral therapy (ART) medicines. Born with the virus, these children need to take two to six capsules daily. For additional infections such as tuberculosis, the pill count could run into double digits. Their very survival depends on following this regimen, but the six-year-old Sumant is among 17 children at the Palawi home who refuse to continue with ART . \u201cChildren go through hell in spite of ART. There is no denying the dramatic shift in HIV care today, but what about those who got the disease at the turn of the century and have spent a lifetime taking medicines. We know little or nothing about what the virus or ART does to each child?\u201d said Palawi's founder, 65-year-old Mangaltai Shah. She says most children in Palawi grapple with problems ranging from skin rashes, oral and vaginal yeast infections, pus accumulation in ears, hearing and vision problems to life-threatening infections such as TB. \u201cSo when medicines meant to heal start giving additional trouble, they find it easier to discard.\u201d Moreover, she adds, at Rs 25 per child per day institutions like Palawi neither have adequate funds nor support from government hospitals to tackle the unique health problems of each child. Sumant is supposed to receive intensive counselling from the local ART centre till his adherence improves, but Shah says the three doctors and four counsellors that cater to 300 HIV patients daily at Solapur Civil Hospital barely have the time to look up. For nearly 3 lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors. Another Palawi resident, four-year-old Khusboo, suffered hearing loss after recurrent ear infections. The diagnosis didn't come from the ART centre, but from her teacher at Palawi\u2019s in-house Gyan Mandir school, who noticed Khusboo was oblivious to classroom activities. The institution was compelled to start its own school in 2014\u2014a ground-plus-one structure next to the orphanage on Pandharpur\u2019s outskirts\u2014as children are denied admission in regular schools the moment Palawi is mentioned. But it\u2019s a blessing in disguise for these children who struggle to sit through more than one or two classes without dozing off. \u201cA regular school wouldn\u2019t understand or probably tolerate it,\u201d Patil says. Palawi which has been home to 250 HIV-positive children since 2001, has lost 40 to the disease. AIDS claims an average of 2,500 lives in Maharashtra annually; how many are children is not known. The state recently discovered that over 30,000 of the two lakh patients on treatment have dropped out. Here too, paediatric percentage is unclear. On paper, 16,000 children in Maharashtra are on treatment. Coping is equally challenging for children in the community, who having lost one or both parents to the virus, face vulnerabilities starting from poor access to healthcare and government entitlements to education and nutrition. Now 17, Palghar native Sachin has been on ART since he was three. He lost his mother at birth and father last December to HIV. He admits to skipping his daily 10-pill regimen. He dropped out of school due to his condition. \u201cThe pain would begin after the morning pills. I would cry in class and be compelled to lie down,\u201d said Sachin who can't keep a job either as the medicines make him \u201cdrowsy and tired\u201d. At four-feet and grossly underweight at 35kg, Sachin typifies the wasting and stunting associated with HIV. HIV is a neurotropic virus that not just attacks the immune system but practically affects every organ, resulting in damage to nerve tissues, cognitive development, physical growth, and at the same time causing learning difficulties, speech and language problems. Experts say it\u2019s crucial to monitor toxicity and provide 360-degree healthcare. Dr Ira Shah, an expert in paediatric HIV, says it\u2019s not enough to tell children to take medicines lifelong. \u201cThese are toxic drugs given at a much younger age. It is necessary to monitor bone health or metabolic acidosis before the children become intolerant,\u201d she said. In one of her published papers, she wrote about three children who died of neurological complications caused by HIV despite their viral load being suppressed with drugs. National Aids Control Organisation deputy director Dr R S Gupta admits little is known about how children cope with ART. But he underlines the fact that \u201cthey live longer because of the medicines and the average life expectancy now exceeds 20.\u201d There are side-effects, but \u201cwhat is important is they are alive\u201d. Ironically, Sumant, Khusboo, Sachin are Indian HIV programme's success stories even though they are not thriving but merely surviving. (Names of all patients have been changed)"}

For the nearly 3 lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors, mostly underpaid, and overburdened with administrative work. A fourth of India's 60,000-odd children taking ART for HIV live in Maharashtra. With no adequate support, the state recently learned that over 30,000 of the two lakh patients on treatment have quietly dropped out."}

Four feet tall and with body weight of 30 kilos, she is at least 25kg underweight and significantly short for her age. Her mental ability is of a kid half her age. She is also hearing impaired. At Solapur\u2019s Palawi-Prabha Hira Pratishthan, one of Maharashtra\u2019s oldest institutions caring for children living with HIV, cases like Sumana\u2019s are not an exception. At least 60% of the 110 children here suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss. The prevalence of height and weight stunting is more than 70%, while over a third have stymied mental development. Besides physical, the prevalence of mental health problems such as depression is alarmingly high. AIDS-related deaths may have dropped 54% and new infections 66% in India over a decade, but children like Sumana are testimony to the gaping deficit in the national programme that focuses on drugs instead of a comprehensive medical, nutritional and psychosocial model that a complex disease like HIV warrants. An otherwise spirited child, Sumant becomes drowsy and irritable after taking medicines. \u201cI get severe stomach-ache, dizziness, headache and diarrhoea,\u201d he says, describing his plight after taking the daily dose of antiretroviral therapy (ART) medicines. The six-year-old is among the 17 children at the Palawi home who have forsaken ART even though their survival depends on it. Born with the virus, these children need to take 2-6 capsules daily. For additional infections such as tuberculosis, the pill count could run into double digits. \u201cChildren go through hell in spite of ART. There is no denying the dramatic shift in HIV care today, but what about those who got the disease at the turn of the century and have spent a lifetime taking medicines? We know little or nothing about what the virus or ART does to each child,\u201d said Palawi\u2019s 65-year-old founder Mangaltai Shah. She says most children in Palawi grapple with everyday health problems ranging from skin rashes, oral and vaginal yeast infections, pus accumulation in ears, hearing and vision problems to life-threatening infections like TB. \u201cSo when medicines meant to heal start giving trouble, they find it easier to discard.\u201d Moreover, she adds, institutions like Palawi neither have adequate funds nor support from government hospitals to tackle the unique problems of each child. Sumant is supposed to receive intensive counselling from the local ART centre till his adherence improves, but Shah says the three doctors and four counsellors that cater to 300 HIV patients daily at Solapur Civil Hospital barely have the time. For nearly 3 lakh registered HIV patients in the state, there are less than 1,000 counsellors. Palawi was compelled to start its own school in 2014 as children are denied admission in regular ones the moment Palawi is mentioned. But it\u2019s a blessing in disguise for these children who struggle to sit through more than one or two classes without dozing off. Palawi, which has been home to 250 HIV-positive children since 2001, has lost 40 to the disease."}

The mystery ended two years ago when her mother succumbed to AIDS following a ten-year battle. Her bedridden father, also afflicted by the virus, broke the news to her just a day later. \u201cIt\u2019s a germ in our blood that will stay with us forever. It has not spared you either,\u201d says Mona, recalling her father\u2019s words. The revelation, she vividly remembers, was followed by a directive to keep it a secret. More than the disease, it was the secrecy that instilled a deep sense of shame. Similarly, Pandharpur native Sundari (13) barely had time to cope with her father\u2019s death when she was told about her HIV status. That was the first time her grandfather told her that it was AIDS that killed her parents. Unable to bear the ill-treatment meted out to her by the extended family, the grandfather put her in an orphanage, where she presently lives. Studies have underlined the criticality of disclosure\u2014telling someone about their HIV status\u2014in fighting the disease and how, when done under tragic circumstances and without counselling, it can damage the way an HIV-infected child or an adolescent view themselves for the rest of their lives. The lack of a holistic framework in India has left parents, caregivers and institutions grappling to find the right approach. Several children discover the ailment accidentally or at the time of losing a parent; many come to know when they are being discriminated against, or worse, after they have been sexually abused. The complex questions of \u2018how to tell\u2019 and \u2018when to tell\u2019 is simply passed over at Pune-based Manavya, one of the oldest homes in Maharashtra to care for HIV positive children. The caretakers never let out the \u201csecret\u201d even as they teach every child how to take medicines and fight the disease. \u201cIf they have questions about HIV, we answer them scientifically,\u201d said Shirish Lawate, trustee of Manavya. Children as young as five start questioning their daily medications. \u201cWe tell them it\u2019s to kill the jantu (organism) inside their body,\u201d says Sushma Apte, one of the coordinators. Visits to hospitals and ART centres seem to be one of the common ways children discover their HIV status. Fifteen-year-old Sushila says, \u201cI figured I had HIV by looking at posters at Solapur Civil Hospital. But it took me a while to understand there are ways other than physical relationships to get HIV,\u201d she says. The teenager is from Palawi in Pandharpur, a residential institution run by Mangaltai Shah and her daughter Dimple Ghadge that provides shelter to 110 HIV children. Ghadge says counselling at state-run ART centres is perfunctory. \u201cThat\u2019s perhaps the reason why mental health issues, particularly depression, mood swings and anger is rampant among them,\u201d says Ghadge. Chinmayi Modi, a member of the National Coalition of People living with HIV India (NCPI+), adds that the incidence of suicides among HIV-affected youth is high but there is no verifiable data. At the Bandra-based CCDT, for in-house residents older than 10-12 years, the disclosure is done gradually keeping the child\u2019s maturity in mind. It\u2019s when families are involved, says programme director Poonam DSouza, that it becomes challenging. \u201cAll parents want to delay it till their children are in late teens,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we discourage late disclosures since children at that age start having relationships and should be aware of the risks of unsafe sex,\u201d she adds. Brahmadev from Vihaan, an NGO working for HIV, says it\u2019s common for children to blame parents, run away from home and stop taking medicines. Unlike practices worldwide, where a lot of thought goes into disclosing a child\u2019s HIV status, no structure exists here, says Shabana Patel, president of Network of Maharashtra People with HIV (NMP+). \"The first counselling when a child starts ART is crucial and should last for a minimum of 45 minutes. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen even for 5 minutes,\" says Patel. In Maharashtra, there is one counsellor for every 300 HIV patients. Parimal Singh, who heads Maharashtra State Aids Control Society, said a methodology is being drawn up to ensure those who have adherence issues don't miss out on quality counselling. Mumbai\u2019s Sion Hospital has developed some tools for this purpose. Counsellor Laxman Jamkhandi uses storytelling to educate his young patients. White cells vital to the immune system assume the role of good soldiers that need the aid of weapons like ART drugs and nutrition to kill the black demon virus. \u201cA superhero story never fails to get the attention of children,\" he says. \"With better ART, children are surviving for decades, so it's better their body and mind starts accepting it early.\u201d"}

With the rupee depreciating sharply against the dollar, apparel exports, which fell 14% year-on-year (y-o-y) in the first four months of 2018-19 (FY19), have slipped by only 1% in US dollar terms in July. Incidentally, apparel exports grew by 6% y-o-y in rupee terms during the same month. Ratings agency ICRA expects India\u2019s apparel exports to grow at a modest pace of 1%-2% for the rest of the 2019 fiscal. Though India\u2019s apparel exports are likely to remain subdued in the near-term, the worst appears to be over, the agency said. With faster GST (Goods and Services Tax) refunds, improved clarity on the rate of export incentives and the sharp rupee depreciation \u2014 witnessed over the past few months \u2014 most of the industry\u2019s concerns have been addressed to a large extent. \u201cThe fall in the rupee is helping apparel exports and the downslide has been arrested,\u201d said Sanjay Jain, chairman, Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI). \u201cGovernment policies are more tuned towards aiding the apparel sector. We expect a 5%-7% growth in apparel exports in the current fiscal,\u201d he said.\u201cThe depreciation in the currency (rupee) has supported the recovery (in exports),\u201d said Raja M Shanmugham, president, Tirupur Exporters\u2019 Association. The rupee depreciated 5% between April and July this year and by over 9% so far in 2018. \u201cThe signs are quite positive. The trade war between the US and China would also help in growing our exports,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the start of this year, apparel exports have been slowing down mainly due to tough competition from other Asian countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh owing to China\u2019s loss of export market share, liquidity challenges, currency fluctuations and uncertainty in policy changes,\u201d said Pushkar Mukewar, co-founder and co-CEO, Drip Capital. \u201cWith several internal as well as external headwinds, the past year turned out to be rather challenging for India\u2019s apparel exporters. Transition to the new taxation regime, besides posing liquidity challenges for the industry, added to uncertainties because of alternating stances on export incentives during the year,\u201d said Jayanta Roy, senior vice president and group head, ICRA.\u201cGoing forward, steps taken by the government to address these concerns, will remain crucial for apparel exporters to capitalise on the revived global apparel trade as well as the continuing loss of market share by China, which opens up a lucrative opportunity for key players such as India, Vietnam and Bangladesh,\u201d he said."}

Failure to detect and treat HIV early may not just cause irreversible neurological damages, but also prove fatal for babies. Doctors at the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital recently discovered the worrying trend while analyzing data of 1,410 babies who were tested for HIV between 2015 and 2018 at the reference laboratory in Kasturba Hospital. At six weeks of birth, infants born to HIV-infected mothers are subjected to the first test, which if positive, is repeated immediately. This second test assumes great significance as the child is immediately started on antiretroviral therapy (ART), if this report too comes positive. The study showed that merely 61% of parents returned for the second confirmatory test. \u201cWe were surprised to see that so many parents are missing out on the second visit, thereby delaying the child\u2019s treatment,\u201d said Dr Jayanthi Shastri, who heads the molecular lab at Kasturba that receives samples from 36 HIV testing and counselling centres across the city. The laboratory also gets dried blood spot samples from Gujarat, Goa and Madhya Pradesh. \u201cSuch a delay is unfortunate as the advances in ART assure that children with HIV escape the serious neurological damages,\u201d she said. Nair hospital\u2019s Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre has found migration to be one of the biggest reasons. \u201cIn 70% of these cases, parents are migrants, who come here for child delivery and return to their hometowns. In a small percentage, it\u2019s also the lack of understanding about the seriousness of HIV,\u201d said Medha Deorukhkar, a counsellor at the centre. Around 46% of children were lost to follow-up, the analysis found. The national protocol warrants that babies be followed up to 18 months as antibodies from mother could give out false positivity in tests carried out before that. In fact, regular follow-ups and counselling are crucial not just for HIV-positive babies, but also for negative ones. While India data is scarce, it has been found that babies who have escaped contracting the virus during birth may still get it through breastfeeding. \u201cCounselling is crucial as mothers may not comprehend the harm of switching between breast milk to formula milk,\u201d said a doctor from Sion hospital\u2019s paediatric centre of excellence for HIV. \u201cBottle feeds cause ulceration on the gut wall, which makes it conducive for the virus to enter the baby\u2019s bloodstream.\u201d Dr Shikala Acharya, assistant project director at Mumbai District Aids Control Society, said while mother-to-child transmission has dropped to less than 0.2%, tracking remains a challenge. In 2017-18, of around 460 deliveries in HIV-positive women, four babies tested positive. She said in families where the couple has not informed extended family, pursuing them to return for testing of the child becomes difficult. But Dr Anju Seth, director of paediatrics at Delhi\u2019s Lady Hardinge Medical College, said it\u2019s worth the effort as virus suppression is crucial here. \u201cThe first three years of a child\u2019s life is when maximum growth happens.

Rajya Sabha passed the bill in March that criminalises discrimination against patients suffering Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a condition caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) , which attacks and weakens the body\u2019s immune system. Here is all you need to know about the act: * The bill is a milestone because it empowers a person living with HIV to report discrimination meted out against them in fields of employment, health care services, educational services, public facilities, property rights, holding public office, and insurance. * The Act penalises \"propagation of hatred\" against the protected person where a violator could be punished with a minimum jail term of three months to a maximum of two years and can be fined up to one lakh rupees. * The Act makes Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) a legal right for all HIV/AIDS patients. It has also adopted \"test and treat\" policy which means any person testing positive will be entitled for free treatment by the state and central government. Earlier, this was restricted by a CD4 count rate. * It also provides for confidentiality of HIV-related information and makes it necessary to get informed consent for undertaking HIV tests, medical treatment and research. * The law makes it mandatory for state governments to appoint an Ombudsman to inquire into complaints related to the violation of the Act and the provision of health care services. * If a person or an institution fails to comply with any order given by the Ombudsman within the stipulated period of time, they could be fined a maximum of Rs 10,000. A continuous failure could lead to an additional fine of up to Rs 5000 every day until the they comply. * The new legislation has provisions to safeguard the property rights of HIV positive people. Every HIV infected person below the age of 18 years has the right to reside in a shared household and enjoy the facilities of the household. * The Bill was initially introduced in Parliament by the UPA government, the amendments to the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2014 were revived by the Narendra Modi government in July last year. * The total number of people living with HIV in India is estimated at 21.17 lakhs, whereas around 86000 new HIV infections were reported in 2015, showing 66% decline in new infections from 2000. In 2015 around 68000 people died of AIDS-related causes nationally. Read this story in Bengali"}

The girl from Thrissur was diagnosed with dextrocardia (condition in which your heart points toward the right side of your chest instead of the left side). She was also suffering from abnormal positions of left and right ventricles and two holes on the wall of the heart (ventricular septum) leading to a dip in oxygen level in her blood. The 3D printing technology helped them create the replica of her heart in its real size and features. Amritha, daughter of auto driver Dinesh Babu and Anitha, was diagnosed with multiple heart disorders when she was an infant. \"Dextrocardia is a rare condition. The girl's ventricles were in superior-inferior (one on the top of the other) relationship unlike the normal right side-left side positioning. She had two holes in the heart's wall. Moreover, the aorta which carries pure blood to different parts of the body was connected to the right ventricle which contains impure blood. So, the blood supplied to her body was a mix of pure and impure,\" said paediatric cardiology professor Dr Mahesh, who heads 3D printing lab of Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS), Kochi. Moreover, there was a block in the pulmonary artery carrying blood from the right ventricle to the lungs for oxygenation. The girl underwent two life-saving surgeries - Glenn shunt and BT shunt - as an infant which helped her gain an oxygen saturation of up to 85%. In July 2018, the doctors conducted complex surgeries to fix the holes in her heart's wall and ensure pure blood flow to aorta. \"We took the 3D images of the girl's heart and made a real-size replica. A team of doctors - including US-based Indian cardiologist Dr Mohan Reddy and AIMS paediatric cardiologist Dr Krishna Kumar studied it. We then conducted a mock surgery on the model heart. This helped us reduce the time required for the surgery, acquire precision and avoid complications,\" said Dr Brijesh Kottayil, consultant cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon, AIMS, Kochi. The surgery, costing Rs 3 lakh, was conducted with financial support from Genesis Foundation, an NGO that facilitates treatment for critically ill and underprivileged children with heart disorders. \"The condition of our daughter has improved a lot. The bluish colour in her body has disappeared,\" said Babu, who was in the hospital with her daughter to attend the first consultation scheduled two months after the surgery."}

The smart hearing aid's here", "article": "NEW DELHI: Soon after K Prasad turned 70, his family noticed that he wouldn't respond when someone called or that he missed large parts of conversations. The doctor diagnosed mild hearing loss and suggested an aid, but the device turned out to be so clunky, noisy \u2014 \"I'd rather not hear at all than have that whistling in my ear\" \u2014 and hard to use, that it spent more time on the shelf than in his ear. And his family got used to shouting at him. Last year though, a doctor found him a discreet device that sits neatly in his ear, and he's adapted to it well. New models of hearing aids are nothing like the analogue equipment our grandparents might have worn. They have superior sound quality and are often as small as a fingernail. \"Earlier, most hearing aids were large and visible. The new ones fit in the inner canal and are almost invisible,\" says Dr J M Has, an ENT expert in Delhi. This is why people are now less hesitant about getting assistive devices, he adds. As lifespans get longer, people have to deal with age-related ailments such as hearing loss, which aren't life-threatening but do cut into the quality of life. But there is no need to suffer in silence. Dr Shalabh Sharma of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi explains that hearing aids work well for people with mild to moderate hearing loss. \"For profound hearing loss, cochlear implants are needed,\" he says. In addition to advanced age (people generally start hearing less by the time they turn 65), listening to loud music on earphones is another reason for the increase in incidence of hearing problems. Mumbai-based audiologist Devangi Dalal says digital aids are better because they can be customised to each user's requirement. \"These aids allow people to hear soft speech louder and ambient sounds softer. Effective noise compression is key to a good hearing aid,\" she adds. Digital aids come with mobile apps that help users get a better listening experience. You can talk on phone and watch your favorite programmes on TV by connecting your aids to it via an app. Even in a conference, a hearing impaired person sitting in the back row can hear clearly. Certain aids come with a mic, which when worn by the speaker can amplify sound without disturbing others. The same technology enables children with hearing impairment to attend a regular school. They can hear the teacher clearly and, therefore, don't need to attend a special school. The latest breakthrough in hearing aid technology is the use of artificial intelligence. Using AI, aids can remember and store different settings of sounds in different situations, and automatically switch to that setting on sensing those frequencies. For instance, explains Paritosh Arora, CEO, Widex India, you go to a movie theater and change the sound setting on your mobile app. Once you're out, the hearing aid senses that and automatically switches back to outdoor setting. \"In the next six months we are launching battery-free aids that will have portable chargers. You charge them for 10 seconds and they are good to use for 24 hours,\" says Arora adding that Widex sells six to seven lakh hearing aids in India every year. Their prices start at Rs 15,500 and go up to Rs 3 lakh and more. There are more innovations on the cards. Devinder Dadwal, marketing head GN Hearing India Pvt Ltd, which sells hearing aids under the brand name ReSound, says the company has recently introduced ReSound Linx Quattro, an aid which has a wider frequency range. \"Users can hear sounds better and understand their source. For example, if you are out for a morning run and there's a truck honking from behind, these aids will help you figure out how far the truck is and the direction of its sound. It also allows health care professionals to remotely adjust or tune hearing aids using a mobile app so that the user does not have to visit the clinic or hospital,\" says Dadwal. He adds that ReSound sells about 50,000 aids each year in India."}

Shortage of the medicine had left pregnant women and new mothers living with HIV, troubled. The city got the first batch of medicines on Wednesday afternoon. The state government had issued a notice saying the drug will not be available until the end of October sending HIV positive mothers into a panic. Nevirapine syrup is given to babies born from HIV positive mothers within 72 hours of birth to reduce the risk of contracting the disease from their mothers. The drug which was available at anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centers was out of stock. It was not available at private organizations as well. After a 20-day delay, the city on Wednesday received its first consignment of Nevirapine syrups. The essential drug was out of stock since the beginning of September. While NGOs were pulling out all stops to get the drug, new mothers and pregnant women were left wringing their hands and worried sick for their babies. People living with HIV were also deprived of combinations of Nevirapine. Speaking to TOI, district AIDS prevention officer Dr Ravi said taking note of the urgency and complaints from NGOs in the city, the state government dispatched Nevirapine syrups for infants. \u201cIt is available at the ART centres and new mothers can avail it. Now there is adequate stock to cater to all pregnant and new mothers with HIV. Newborns are our priority,\u201d he stated. Chandrashekar, head of the city-based NGO Anandajyothi, said that he had written several mails to the authorities and health officers seeking supply of the essential drug. \u201cWhen NACO replied stating a three-month delay in the supply of Nevirapine, we were shocked. The drug is a necessity for newborns and pregnant women. The drug was available at ART centres but not in medical stores in the city. Since 20 days, people with HIV, parents of newborn would visit hospitals and go back crestfallen. New mothers were worried as it was the question of their child\u2019s health. Despite repeated requisitions, the medicine was delayed by 20 days,\u201d he added. According to statistics, the city currently has over a dozen HIV positive pregnant women. Nevirapine syrup is said to reduce the chances of a newborn acquiring the virus from the infected mother. It is given to babies within 24 hours of birth up till 45 days. What is Nevirapine? Nevirapine is a prescription medicine for the treatment of HIV infection in adults and children. It is said to prevent postnatal HIV infection. Nevirapine is always used in combination with other HIV medicines. - (By Akshatha J)"}

They claim the revelation turned their lives upside down, causing them mental agony and pushing them into depression. Halappa KB, 60, and Sushmitha, 21, are residents of Davanagere. Halappa, a labourer, got admitted to City Central Hospital in December 2017 for acute leg pain, followed by blockage in his veins. He alleged that no consent was taken from him for the HIV test nor was he informed while his blood was being drawn. His son Raju H is now running from pillar to post seeking justice and has complained to the consumer court as well, claiming that his father had to face stigma due to the false positive reports. \u201cThe hospital conducted an HIV test without our knowledge and consent. It claimed that the report was positive and refused to conduct cardiac surgery on my father. He slipped into depression and even attempted suicide. We brought him to a private hospital in Bengaluru and got him tested for HIV. But the report was negative and he even underwent the operation. My complaint to the health department has been ignored and justice has been delayed,\u201d Raju told TOI. Sushmitha had visited the Davanagere hospital in March for a prenatal check-up when she was five months pregnant. \u201cThe blood test was done on March 23. But they asked us to collect the report after three days. We were shocked with the findings \u2014 they showed she was HIV-positive \u2014 and underwent stress and psychological trauma,\u201d said her husband Prahlad S, a police constable. The couple then went to the government-run Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre for HIV testing. Till then, they had no idea that the report issued by the private hospital was false. \u201cICTC\u2019s report revealed Sushmitha was not HIV-positive, which came as a huge relief. But the private hospital was firm on its stand. If they had a doubt, they should have conducted another test,\u201d said Prahlad. Sushmitha\u2019s medical negligence complaint with the health department is pending inquiry. Prahlad added that the hospital didn\u2019t even bother to counsel them when they were traumatised after seeing the report. Dr Raghavan GD, district HIV/AIDS control officer, Davanagere, said he was asked by the district health officer to inquire into both the complaints. \u201cIn Halappa\u2019s case, the inquiry report has been submitted to the government, but the findings can\u2019t be disclosed. In the other case, the inquiry is yet to begin,\u201d he said. Cases pending before court: Hospital When TOI contacted the hospital authorities, they refused to comment but neither denied nor admitted to the allegations. \u201cThe cases are pending before the consumer court. At this stage, we can\u2019t comment on the complaints. We have cooperated with the health department for the inquiry,\u201d said Padmanabh UR, administrator, City Central Hospital. \u2018Negligence cases not under KPME Act\u2019 In 2017, the state witnessed a series of protests by doctors when the government initiated amendments to the Karnataka Private Medical Establishment (KPME) Act to regulate private medical establishments. Though the amendments were made, they were called the watered-down version of those intended. In the two cases, the patients have sought action under the KPME Act. \u201cBut the Act authorises us only to check and take measures if a hospital/clinic is functioning without registration.

The Act bars insurance companies from discriminating against HIV-positive individuals. However, most insurance companies have stayed away from launching products for HIV/AIDS patients due to pricing-related issues. \"If the immunity is low due to a person being HIV-positive, treatment expenses go up several times.

New cases of HIV among gay and bisexual men fell by almost a third to the lowest on record, according to the world\u2019s first study to measure the impact of Gilead Sciences Inc's Truvada pill on reducing the AIDS-causing virus in a large population. The results, published Thursday in the Lancet HIV medical journal, may pave the way for other states and countries to stop transmission of the virus with the use of a treatment called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. \"The speed of the decline we\u2019ve seen in new HIV infections in gay and bisexual men is a world first,\" said study leader Andrew Grulich, head of HIV epidemiology and prevention at the Kirby Institute of the University of New South Wales. \"These numbers are the lowest on record since HIV surveillance began in 1985.\" Progress against AIDS over the past 15 years has inspired a commitment by UN member states to end the epidemic by 2030. The number of people newly infected with HIV fell to 1.8 million worldwide in 2017, from more than 3 million a year through most of the 1990s. While the study results can\u2019t be generalized to indicate similar efficacy in heterosexual populations, they do demonstrate that PrEP is \"highly cost-effective\" in certain high-risk groups, Grulich said in a phone interview. New HIV infections occurred in 102 gay and bisexual men in the state of New South Wales in the first year after the study began, compared with 149 infections in the 12 months prior. \"While we\u2019ve known for at least three or four years now of individual-level efficacy of PrEP, there has been some reticence around the world by policy makers to properly fund the roll out of PrEP because the population impact hasn\u2019t been shown -- and that\u2019s what we set out to do,\" Grulich said. There were about 180,000 people in the US taking Truvada for PrEP at the end of June, Robin L. Washington, Gilead\u2019s chief financial officer, said on a conference call in July. The blue, oval-shaped pill is a fixed-dose combination of the drugs tenofovir, disoproxil and emtricitabine. Generic versions of Truvada made by Mylan NV, Cipla Ltd. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. have made the medication available more cheaply. \"We see the nice steady growth of Truvada for the use of PrEP,\" Gilead\u2019s Chief Executive Officer John F. Milligan told the Morgan Stanley Global Health Care Conference last month. Areas of the US with the highest uptake of PrEP had achieved some of the best reductions in HIV infections, he said. \"I\u2019m more confident now that the policymakers are being very innovative in thinking about how to increase access to PrEP,\" Milligan said. \"So we\u2019ll be working on a number of things in the coming year that could really increase the number of patients on PrEP and could be very good for preventing the infection, and of course good for our business as well.\""}

The convict is HIV-positive and unemployed. He used to rape the girl when her mother went to work. The minor girl has not contracted HIV despite being raped by an infected person from 2008 to 2014 in their house in Sachin area of the city. The convict had divorced his wife to get married to the rape survivor\u2019s mother. He started raping the girl when she was a student of class VI. The girl\u2019s mother was forced to work to support the family because the convict was unemployed. She used to do textile- related job work at home and then went out to sell textile products. The woman\u2019s younger son used to be in school when the convict raped his stepdaughter. He threatened her if she told anyone about it. The girl did not complain to her mother until November 25, 2014 when the convict slapped her alleging that she was having an affair with a man. The girl told her mother that the convict has been raping her since 2008 when she was 10-year-old. The girl\u2019s mother took help of a social worker and approached police, who after registration of the complaint arrested the man and sent him to jail. \u201cThe 52-year-old man was convicted for raping his minor stepdaughter and sentenced to 10 years in jail.

Police said in a statement they received a complaint that the suspect was using fake social media profiles on Facebook and the gay dating app Blued to win the trust of his victims so they would send him nude photos before agreeing to meet him. When they found out he was not who he pretended to be online, he would threaten to make their nude photos public if they refused to have sex with him. Police Lt. Col. Nacharot Kaewpetch said the police discovered medicine for treating HIV when they arrested the 43-year-old suspect, Sgt. Maj. Jakkrit Khomsing, at his home Wednesday in the northeastern province of Khon Kaen. They said tests confirmed he was infected with HIV. So far police have determined that Jakkrit had more than 70 victims between the ages of 13 and 18. \"Even though the suspect is a soldier, this behavior and I've consulted with army commanders is a personal issue, not an organizational one,'' police Maj. Gen. Surachate Hakparn said. Police said they are widening their investigation and attempting to contact other victims who have not yet filed charges. Police have so far charged Jakkrit with six offenses, including sex with a minor under 15 with or without their consent, punishable by 4-20 years in prison; indecent assault of a minor under 15 using threats, punishable by up to 10 years in prison; separating a minor under 15 from their parents without reason, punishable by 3-15 years in prison; blackmail, punishable by up to 3 years in prison; and coercing minors to conduct inappropriate acts, punishable by up to three months in prison."}

However, the hospital has dismissed allegations of discrimination. For the past three years, the man has been undergoing treatment in Bengaluru to avoid the stigma he might face in his native town. Earlier this year, he was diagnosed with renal failure and was put on dialysis at INU in May 2018. However in July, he was told to seek treatment at his native place or in any other hospital. He was a construction labourer and as he\u2019s suffering from tuberculosis and kidney disorder, he\u2019s unable to work now. His homemaker wife is also an HIV patient. Their only son is pursuing graduation in Chintamani. His wife told STOI they\u2019re facing discrimination everywhere. \u201cI approached the government hospital in Chintamani also, but considering his HIV status, they said as it\u2019s a high-risk case he needed a separate machine for dialysis However, doctors claimed all patients who come to INU are initially treated here as it\u2019s a peripheral centre. Later, they are advised to go back to their native places for further treatment as these facilities are available in all districts now. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of discrimination. I will look into the issue,\u201d said institute director Dr Shivalingaiah. He said over 80 patients undergo dialysis every day and had to be taken to INU only. We went to INU last week, but the hospital is not treating him,\u201d she alleged. She said from May to July, he was put on dialysis thrice a week. But it stopped since July. When his condition worsened a week ago, INU refused treatment. The family tried its luck with other government hospitals in Bengaluru, but was turned away on the grounds that he required a special machine for dialysis."}

The boat, owned by Cleetus, which is of Tamil Nadu origin, was crippled following a suspected defect in its prime motor, said DIG S S Dasila, commander, Coast Guard, Karnataka. Noting that fishing boat Luminous was reported to be in distress by a Coast Guard Dornier on a routine sortie, Dasila said Coast Guard district headquarters 3, Panambur, diverted its New Mangalore Port-based ICGS Vikram out on patrol, to aid the stricken boat. The crew attempted to rectify the defect in the motor and the fuel pump, but the engine failed to start when cranked. Kavaratti based DHQ 12 made arrangements for further rectification of the stricken fishing boat, he noted. Fishing boat Luminous was towed safely to Bitra Island around 12.30pm on Tuesday, and will be handed over to the owners for further action, Dasila said, urging fishing boats not to venture out alone, but in groups, for their own safety, in case of mechanical failures or other emergencies. \u201cThe Coast Guard is committed to rescuing lives at sea, and use of its assets should be called for only in case of extreme emergencies, where loss of life is imminent,\u201d he noted."}

Justice C Hari Shankar reversed the trial court\u2019s verdict awarding 10-year jail to the accused, saying it would be a \"travesty of justice\" to convict him of having committed such an \u201cunsolved\u201d crime. The high court, in its 69-page judgement, noted that while the child was HIV positive, accused Amardeep Kujur tested negative and noted that there were allegations that the child was sexually assaulted multiple times. It underlined that the possibility of non-transmission of the HIV virus to the accused would be remote and disagreed with the trial court\u2019s finding that it was not necessary that the HIV virus would, in every case of sexual contact, be transmitted from partner to partner. Justice Shankar observed that the trial judge \u201cignored the above two facts, apparent from the evidence, i.e., firstly, that the child had suffered mucosal tears in the private parts and, secondly, that the man was alleged to have repeatedly sexually assaulted the child. Sexual contact is, it is well known, the primary mode by which HIV virus is transmitted.\u201d In the judgement, the high court said the mystery of how the assaulter entered the room where the minor was sleeping, and sodomised him day after day, remained unanswered. \u201cThe situation, in the present case, remains a classic, and unsolved \u2018locked room mystery\u2019, even while the man stands convicted and sentenced (by the trial court). This is entirely impermissible in law,\u201d HC noted. While the child's father was in jail, his mother had died of HIV and, as there was not nobody to look after him, he was sent to the children home for boys."}
